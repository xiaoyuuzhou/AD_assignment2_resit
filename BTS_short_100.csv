Author's Note:

Idol HP au has been in my head for days now cause Cat (CocoaCatnip) and I have been freaking out over it, and she wrote a cute thing (go read it, it's precious cute fluffy daejae) so I decided to write a thing, and since I've been on a namjin kick lately... ye. This turned out a lot fluffier than I was expecting, jeez. Featuring Hufflepuff 5th Year Seokjin and Ravenclaw 4th Year Namjoon, because yes.

It was around the time of night that things usually quieted down around the school, late enough that those who'd been set on making a good time of the night had petered off into smaller, quieter groups tucked out of easy sight, and those who actually cared about being awake for morning classes had long fallen asleep. Give or take a few handfuls of last minute homework-ers. Seokjin would've liked to be one of the privileged already getting their beauty rest, but instead, he was en route to the library, robes lined with a generous supply of leftovers and snacks liberated from the kitchen. It was all because he's the kindest, most thoughtful, and caring soul this side of Hogwarts, of course. And because he was pretty sure Kim Namjoon would've starved to death three months into his first year here if it wasn't for him. And so he goes, through empty halls and past dozing paintings under dim lights, into the library and deeper inside, to one of the furthest tables back, covered almost completely—there's about a three-by-five inch space of actual clear table, it's kind of a miracle—by too many opened books and not enough spare parchment.

Naturally, Namjoon barely registers anything outside of the text he's poured himself over, let alone looks up to greet him, so Seokjin settles unceremoniously into a spare seat and starts rearranging books to give himself at least a square foot of space to work with. This takes a full seven and a half minutes to achieve, but when he's done, Seokjin glances around warily and finally pulls out one of the saved pastries from dinner. It's not Namjoon's favorite, but it's pleasantly fragrant and looks appetizing enough to tempt even the most steadfast deniers, so he sets it on his cleared patch of table and clears his throat.

He then clears his throat three more times. And calls Namjoon's name twice. And, finally, reaches over to snap the book the other boy's buried himself in shut, nearly taking his nose off in the process.

It's only at this point that Namjoon looks up and, eyes wide and surprised, acknowledges his presence.

""Hyung? When did you get here..""

Pleased with finally being noticed, Seokjin sits back and wasted no time in motioning down to the pastry he'd so carefully put on display.

""About fifteen minutes ago. Eat.""

Whatever uncertain reply Namjoon had been working on died down into a series of quiet half mumbles when his eyes dropped to the pastry and his stomach promptly staged a siege of any and all higher functions in order to convince its owner that it was damn well time to eat and that it would be ignored no longer. What happened next was gruesome and unsightly and fit only for the goriest of B-rated muggle horror flicks.. and when Namjoon was done eating—if you could call it that.. personally, Seokjin found the word 'destroyed' to be more fitting—the Hufflepuff helpfully produced another pastry for him, only to watch that disappear just as quickly.

""As usual, I was right. You'd starve yourself to death if I wasn't watching.""

Namjoon only laughed in reply, then sheepishly swept crumbs off the pages of his books and swallowed. ""Give me a little credit, hyung..""

""Maybe when you earn it. Or when you stop forgetting to eat while you study.""

With each snack that Namjoon devoured, Seokjin continued to produce one more, unfailing in his supply, which Namjoon had always found to be terribly magical of him. Magical even for a wizard in a school for magic, which was saying something, or so he figured. And this was how they lost another hour to a little quiet chatting and a lot of barely quiet eating, Namjoon only managing to choke twice and Seokjin rolling his eyes and stifling a laugh both times. They both knew they'd be here again in a day or two, as they'd been for the past three years, and neither had much to say in way of complaints about the fact. It was a comfortable routine they'd developed, even though Seokjin would occasionally pout and sigh and remind Namjoon how lucky they were that he was infinitely handsome, or else all the beauty sleep he'd been missing out on would've made him unbearable to look at by now.

By the time Seokjin had convinced the other boy to call it a night, the hour was slowly edging closer to 3AM and the halls were silent, save for the quiet snores and breaths from the paintings, along with the occasional stuff grumble for them to get back to their dorms. So they walk along extra quiet, the textbooks split evenly between both their arms—because the last time he'd let Namjoon try and carry all of his books by himself, he'd ended up watching the Ravenclaw nearly kill himself tripping after the strap on his bag snapped, and as funny as the sight had been at the time, the bruises Namjoon had ended up with afterwards had made the Hufflepuff wince in sympathy.

With Namjoon talking in animated hushed tones about the new spells he's been learning and how he was working them into his music projects, Seokjin managed to get away with walking the younger boy most of the way to his dorm before the other noticed, and it was only then that he begrudgingly piled his half of the books into Namjoon's arms to send him off on his own. Watching the other wrestle with the stack and try to keep his footing steady for nearly a minute, Seokjin sighed and pulled out his wand, casting a quiet spell to lighten the weight and ensure that Namjoon at least had a chance to getting back to his bed without being crushed by a wayward bookfall.

The bright smile this earned him from the Ravenclaw warmed Seokjin all the way down to his toes and he really couldn't help but smile back.

""You gotta teach me that one later, hyung.""

Stepping in closer with a laugh, Seokjin nodded and leaned in to plant a little kiss on Namjoon's cheek, ruffling his hair into an even messier mop than it had already been and pulling out another snack—out of nowhere, Namjoon was convinced—to pop it into the other's mouth.

""Maybe if you don't forget to eat like a normal person for a whole week.""

All Namjoon could do with a full mouth was whine and make puppy eyes at the Hufflepuff, but it was effective enough judging by the warm way Seokjin laughed and patted his cheek.

""Go to bed, Namjoonie.""

It took a couple more minutes of smiles and waves and goodbyes and general lingering for the two to finally go their separate ways, and despite the ungodly hour and the promise of an early morning filled with classes they actually had to try and pay attention to, somehow, they both went to bed with smiles on their faces and a warmth in their chests that even the most advanced spell couldn't dream of replicating."

You stumbled through the apartment door, splatters of rain following you over the threshold. With a thud your bag found the floor of your entryway. Awkwardly and with a lot of barely coherent mumbled curses you tripped out of your shoes, tottering in the direction of the kitchen.

As you were leaning heavily against the counter, trying with shaking fingers to get the kettle going so you could make tea, you heard the bedroom door slam open and the familiar thumping of the apartment's other inhabitant hurrying into the room. Min Yoongi came barrelling in, his face dark like thunder. He stopped in the doorway to take in your bedraggled appearance and watched you fail several times to get the stove going. Silent as ever, he padded to your side, taking the kettle from you and instead catching your fingers in his own. His thumbs gently stroked the bruises he found scattered across your knuckles.

""Where have you been, jagi? I was really worried, you know."" It wasn't a reprimand, you could tell by the broken edge to his quiet whisper. You watched his thumbs move to the backs of your hands, rubbing circles into your chilled skin, rather than look at his face.

""Sorry, Yoongi."" He dropped your hands to cup your cheeks, making you tilt your head just slightly so he could study your streaked makeup and damp eyes.

""Jagiya,"" he prompted again, still gentle as if handling a something small or fragile, ""what happened?"" Your expression finally shifted slightly as you bit your lip, eyebrows drawing into a sharp angle and pushed toward the center of your forehead. Your eyes found the stack of dishes in the sink. How long had you kept him waiting? Hours, you knew, but the exact number was a hazy mystery. Were those dishes all from him, or had he perhaps invited some of his groupmates over to try and ease the worry about you that had eaten away at him until now? Guilt dropped heavy as stone into your tumultuous stomach.

""It's nothing,"" you tried, and he frowned.

""That's a damn lie. You know I hate it when you lie, (y/n)-ah."" Foiled, but it had still been worth a shot. With a heavy sigh, you gently moved his hands from your face and used them to lead him to the couch. Your bones sagged toward the earth, leading you to collapse heavily onto the familiar upholstery; he joined you, perching more cautiously than your graceless flop.

""Really, Yoongie, it wasn't much. Just a series of misfortunes that made for a miserable night and a few hours in the rain. I'm sorry I worried you."" Your voice was quiet, but the silence in the rest of the house made it sound even more muffled to your ears, as if the stillness in the air was so thick it stopped your voice travelling much more than a few centimeters from your lips. Yoongi put a hand on your knee, drawing closer.

""That doesn't really explain why you look so awful. Why won't you tell me what happened?"" You bit your lip, looking at his long fingers, then sighed.

""Well, you know I went out with my friends tonight for Ha Na's birthday."" He nodded and you looked away, embarassed by the rest of the story. ""We were at a club, and even though I said I shouldn't drink and couldn't afford to, my friends kept passing theirs to me. Before I knew it I was pretty drunk, and-and I don't remember a lot after that. I think..."" You trailed off, your lips starting to quiver as vague memories surfaced of strange sensations on more intimate parts of your skin, and blurry shapes of people and places you couldn't quite place now that you were sober again. ""I got a little out of control. Someone... touched me. He didn't get far,"" you addd quickly, seeing the look on your boyfriend's face. ""We were all dancing and he tried to get a little too close. Min Young sent him running for the hills, though. But I just..."" You buried your head in your hands. ""I hate when I get like that. I feel like I lose all control. I'm not myself anymore.""

You felt the couch cushions shift, and suddenly Yoongi's hands were moving in warm, soothing circles across your back in spite of the damp jacket still draped across your shoulders. You chanced a look at him. The look on his face was carefully pensive, a mask you recognized as the one he wore when he was upset but didn't want you to see. Leaning closer, you looked him earnestly in the eye, and put a hand on his knee.

""I'm so sorry, Yoongi. I tried to get a taxi home, really, but I couldn't find one, and I didn't want to stay out too late, so I tried to walk, but it started raining, and I didn't have any umbrella, so I tried to run and at one point I slipped and that's why I'm wet, and then walking took longer, too, so-"" Your stream of excuses was cut short by him wrapping his arms around you. Cradled against his chest, you blinked in surprise. This was sort of the opposite of the reaction you'd expected. You held still, not wanting to say or do anything that would change his mind about embracing you rather than lecturing.

""I'm not mad, jagi. I was just really worried. And when I saw you looking all wet and messed up, I was scared something had happened."" There weren't any words you could think of to reply with, so you said nothing, instead pressing closer to his chest and wrapping your arms tightly around his waist. ""I'm just glad you're okay. You're home now, that's all that matters.""

""Yes,"" you answered softly, squeezing him even tighter, ""I'm home now."" You stayed like that, Yoongi stroking your hair gently and you curled in his lap. After a few minutes, he pulled back to give you a stern look.

""But next time, call me, okay? If you can't get a taxi yourself I can get you, or call one for you. No more stumbling home in the rain at night by yourself, okay?"" You nodded and he pressed a kiss to your forehead. ""You're my girl,"" he said firmly. ""I don't want anything to happen to you, ever. I won't let it. Got it?"" You nodded again and he pulled you closer for a sweet kiss on your still damp lips.

""Oppa,"" you cooed, running your fingers through his hair. ""Would you help me get out of these clothes? They're all wet, and if I stay in them I could catch a cold."" A sly grin crossed his lips as you batted your eyelashes innocently at him.

""Can't have that, can we?"" Without waiting for an answer, he scooped you up and headed for the bathroom, you giggling the whole way."

This is literally trash omg what I am doing with my life?

""Well you're up unusually early this morning."" You smiled at the figure on the couch while running your fingers through yourhair. You were feeling a bit lazy today so you decided to sleep in a little, but waking up at 10AM instead of 9AM was actually too pitiful to be considered 'sleeping in'.

But you couldn't help it. You were an early riser, a fact which still confounded Yoongi even after three years of being together.

Yoongi grunted a ""good morning"" from his position, still hunched over the laptop. You saw the black and red chunky noise-canceling headphones strung around his neck and took it as a sign that he was caught up in his work.

You hoped that it didn't have to do with their upcoming album when its release date was just four days away, and then slipped quietly into the kitchen to make some breakfast.

He was getting thinner by the day, you realized as you rummaged through the fridge for some eggs. That 'diet' wasn't doing anything for him, and Yoongi seemed paler than he should be. You nudged the fridge door shut with your hip, eying the list of dietary restrictions taped onto it with disdain before ignoring it completely; Yoongi was living under your roof, and if you can get away with feeding him good food then you're gonna goddamn do as you please.

It helped that Suga was more than willing to go along with it.

He shuffled in some time later when you were putting out the plates of food and fruit, searching wordlessly through the cupboard for mugs and condiments for his morning coffee. You flicked the switch off on the coffee maker and went for the utensil drawer, grabbing the ketchup from the counter on your way.

When you both sat down at the little table made for two, Yoongi surveyed the breakfast and let out an amused chuckle. ""Cooking off the menu again, are we?""

You smiled cheekily and handed him a napkin. ""My roof, my kitchen, my rules.""

He passes you your coffee -two creams and three sugars- made just the way you like it. ""I should bring the boys here more.""

You hand him the ketchup for his omelet. ""You should. They look like they need to gain a few pounds.""

""After promotions then. Let's all have dinner together here or something."" Suga suggested and brought his coffee to his lips. You mentally laughed at his choice of mugs this morning; he had picked out the simple white one with the words 'Don't fuck with me if this isn't empty' etched in black.

You nodded and hummed in agreement, picking at the sausages. ""Is everything okay?"" You asked carefully. ""You were up before me.""

Yoongi shook his head, waiting to swallow his food before answering. ""No. Got a call this morning from the manager. Apparently there was a virus in the studio's computer system and it wiped out like, half of our album.""

Your fork paused halfway to your mouth. ""Shit.""

""Yeah, but it's okay. I thought ahead and backed up most of the work onto my laptop. But the vocals are completely gone, so we'll have to record the last four songs again."" Yoongi sighed and tousled his hair in annoyance. ""Namjoon and his fucking porn.""

You laughed despite the dire situation. ""He's got that young blood, after all. I'm assuming I won't get to see you much before you leave for promotions?"" You asked even though you already know the answer.

At this question, Suga looked disheartened. ""Sorry babe.""

""It's not like I'm giving you shit about it."" You shrugged, even though you did feel a little sad. You were hoping to spend the last few days with him before promotions and tours start kicking off again. ""Work is work. Don’t worry, I'll survive. I'm a big girl.""

A small, but sad smile graced Yoongi's lips. He got up and walked over, wrapping his pale arms around your figure and resting his head on top of yours. He kissed your hair and played with your soft locks, buying his face into the crook of your neck. ""When I get back, I promise...""

You smiled. ""I know.""

""I love you.""

""I know that too.""

""Say it back.""

You laughed at his neediness. ""I love you, Yoongi-ah.""

Suga grunted an approval, tightening his hug before resuming his place to finish breakfast. The both of you ate in comfortable silence, enjoying each other's company and the aroma of strong coffee. He finishes his breakfast before you do, and you leave the plates on the table to follow him, helping him pack stuff that he tend to forget (""Your laptop charger, Yoongi. For God's sake"").

When it was time to leave, Yoongi reluctantly dragged himself to the front door. Pulling you into a one-armed hug, Suga kissed you gently on the forehead and murmured, ""I'll see you when I get back, and I'll call whenever I can.""

You nodded and kissed him solidly on the lips. ""Take care of yourself and the boys.""

Suga nodded and stepped out into the hallway. Before you can close the door, he turned around and graced you with that heart-stopping wink, with his lips split wide into his trademark gummy smile.

""Oh, by the way, you should always wear my clothes when I'm around.""

You looked down at your attire in confusion and blinked in surprise. You hadn't realized that the 'shorts' were actually his boxers, and that the t-shirt wasn't yours either. By the time you looked back up, your boyfriend had already stepped into the elevator, his smug cackles echoing after his footsteps. You rolled your eyes and closed the door behind you, shaking your head at his attempts to be smooth. It was sad that they work every time though.

Standing alone in your living room, you wrapped your arms around yourself and smiled.

They were more comfortable than your own clothes anyway.

wtf is this idk

It was hard enough filling out an application, and even more so when Jimin couldn't find a proper writing utensil for the job at stake. He'd searched through his book bag and all around the damn apartment for a stupid black pen, one that would have enough ink to fill out the worksheet and hopefully land him a new job. In all honesty, he'd never done this before, even though he was almost twenty and in college, while living with his boyfriend. As a young teen he got it easy by working at his father's coffee shop and he hadn't needed to fill out any type of job application.

But after his father fell ill and had to close down the shop, he was in desperate need of a job because his beloved boyfriend was struggling to pay the bills by himself.

Someone in their right mind would think that a hardworking college student has hundreds of pens and pencils laying mindlessly around, and yet there was nothing of the sort. For a moment Jimin thought about sneaking into Yoongi's studio just down the road and stealing one of his pens from the giant cup he always had placed on his desk. Or possibly he could go to the store and buy an entire pack of black ballpoints and save the other ones for school!

Well, he would have done just that, but Yoongi kept his studio doors locked and was the only person to own a key and Jimin didn't have a single dollar to his name so buying them was out of the equation.

Jimin sighed and slumped down on the sofa with his sorry little application in hand, knocking his head back against the cushions with a loud groan. Yoongi would be home from classes in one hour, and because he was always responsible and owned the things he needed, there wasn't a doubt that he had some pens.

But Jimin was a very impatient man, mind you, and with another moan of annoyance he pushed himself off the couch and went rummaging through the apartment for something, anything to complete this damn job application.

Much to his dismay, he found two pens, both of which were glittery gel pens with vibrant, sparkling ink. One green and the other purple.

“It could work,” Jimin mumbled to himself as he slipped into the chair by the table. He popped the cap of the purple one and printed his name on the dotted line, hardly being bothered by the vibrant, shiny color. He continued filling out the information (what happened to applying online?), losing track of time because who knew a job application was so hard to complete?

It wasn't until he heard the door unlock and open that he lifted his head and craned his neck to look past the kitchen wall and into the living room, where Yoongi was leaning forward to pick up their cat Mitsy to greet her.

“How was class?” Jimin asked, looking back at his rather vibrant piece of paper in front of him. Maybe the manager of this job would think he was artistic.

Yoongi sighed and set the animal down, taking an extra moment to shed his jacket and school bag before moving to the kitchen for a glass of milk. “Boring as hell. How is your job application going?”

Jimin thought it was going great; he filled out the needed information, completed most of the questions and even kept a steady pace of nice penmanship for the most part. If he didn't get this job, he'd be surprised, really. “Everything is good, hyung,” he assured with a smile, watching as Yoongi rounded the corner and met him halfway for a light kiss.

“Let me see,” he ordered with a soft smile as he pulled himself back, fingers already catching the slip of paper before Jimin could stop him. One glance was all it took before the elder was a laughing mess against the kitchen floor, clutching at his stomach as the fit of giggles escaped his lips. “What the fuck, Park Jimin? Filling out an application with a sparkly purple pen? What were you thinking?”

It was almost hard to understand him, because the guy was laughing so hard. Jimin crossed his arms over his chest and frowned; what was so wrong with that? “What? I couldn't find anything else!” he cried defensively, lip jutting out in a hard pout.

Yoongi tried his hardest to quiet the loud, cackling laughter as he pushed himself off the floor and into the chair next to the confused looking boy. “Baby, why didn't you wait until I got home? I would have given you a lifetime supply of black ink pens.”

Jimin was embarrassed then, his cheeks aflame and tinged pink as he looked down at his folded hands placed against his lap. “I was impatient,” he mumbled, not daring to look Yoongi in the eye in fear of being made fun of. “Besides, what's so wrong with a purple pen?”

Yoongi was howling again, one of his hands clamped over his mouth to hush him up as he leaned forward to pull Jimin against him. “Jimin,” he cooed, his chest constricting with each bout of giggles that escaped his lungs.

Jimin huffed softly and pulled away, still pouting because what the hell was so wrong with a purple pen? Sure, it sparkled, but so what? He bet many people used gel pens to complete important applications! Why else would they have been made? “Whatever,” Jimin grunted, snatching his vibrant paper before Yoongi could tease him further. “I'll finish it and turn it in tomorrow morning.”

~*~

Jimin did, in fact, turn in his application the next morning and was told by a skeptical looking woman that he'd get a call in the next few days to decide if he'd gotten the job or not.

He went about his life as usual; morning classes and evenings spent cuddling Yoongi and the cat. He even prepared a lovely pizza dinner for the both of them on Friday, because he felt like surprising Yoongi after his hard day at work.

Yoongi had presented Jimin with another job application at the same office place he worked at a week later, not even forgetting to pass him a black ink pen with a soft smile. “Here. I'm sure you'll get hired this time.”

Jimin felt disheartened but began filling it out anyway, with Yoongi sitting beside him to give extra help.

His cellphone rang once, than twice with an unknown number flashing against the screen. For a moment he thought about forgetting it and continuing the paperwork, but something in his chest pulled him to reach for the device and answer it.

“Hello?”

Yoongi watched as the younger boy listened to the voice on the other end of the line, eyes wide and lips parted as he suddenly spewed out many 'thank you's.

When he hung up, there was a smug look on his face. “I got the job,” he stated proudly."

This is literally trash omg what I am doing with my life?

""Well you're up unusually early this morning."" You smiled at the figure on the couch while running your fingers through yourhair. You were feeling a bit lazy today so you decided to sleep in a little, but waking up at 10AM instead of 9AM was actually too pitiful to be considered 'sleeping in'.

But you couldn't help it. You were an early riser, a fact which still confounded Yoongi even after three years of being together.

Yoongi grunted a ""good morning"" from his position, still hunched over the laptop. You saw the black and red chunky noise-canceling headphones strung around his neck and took it as a sign that he was caught up in his work.

You hoped that it didn't have to do with their upcoming album when its release date was just four days away, and then slipped quietly into the kitchen to make some breakfast.

He was getting thinner by the day, you realized as you rummaged through the fridge for some eggs. That 'diet' wasn't doing anything for him, and Yoongi seemed paler than he should be. You nudged the fridge door shut with your hip, eying the list of dietary restrictions taped onto it with disdain before ignoring it completely; Yoongi was living under your roof, and if you can get away with feeding him good food then you're gonna goddamn do as you please.

It helped that Suga was more than willing to go along with it.

He shuffled in some time later when you were putting out the plates of food and fruit, searching wordlessly through the cupboard for mugs and condiments for his morning coffee. You flicked the switch off on the coffee maker and went for the utensil drawer, grabbing the ketchup from the counter on your way.

When you both sat down at the little table made for two, Yoongi surveyed the breakfast and let out an amused chuckle. ""Cooking off the menu again, are we?""

You smiled cheekily and handed him a napkin. ""My roof, my kitchen, my rules.""

He passes you your coffee -two creams and three sugars- made just the way you like it. ""I should bring the boys here more.""

You hand him the ketchup for his omelet. ""You should. They look like they need to gain a few pounds.""

""After promotions then. Let's all have dinner together here or something."" Suga suggested and brought his coffee to his lips. You mentally laughed at his choice of mugs this morning; he had picked out the simple white one with the words 'Don't fuck with me if this isn't empty' etched in black.

You nodded and hummed in agreement, picking at the sausages. ""Is everything okay?"" You asked carefully. ""You were up before me.""

Yoongi shook his head, waiting to swallow his food before answering. ""No. Got a call this morning from the manager. Apparently there was a virus in the studio's computer system and it wiped out like, half of our album.""

Your fork paused halfway to your mouth. ""Shit.""

""Yeah, but it's okay. I thought ahead and backed up most of the work onto my laptop. But the vocals are completely gone, so we'll have to record the last four songs again."" Yoongi sighed and tousled his hair in annoyance. ""Namjoon and his fucking porn.""

You laughed despite the dire situation. ""He's got that young blood, after all. I'm assuming I won't get to see you much before you leave for promotions?"" You asked even though you already know the answer.

At this question, Suga looked disheartened. ""Sorry babe.""

""It's not like I'm giving you shit about it."" You shrugged, even though you did feel a little sad. You were hoping to spend the last few days with him before promotions and tours start kicking off again. ""Work is work. Don’t worry, I'll survive. I'm a big girl.""

A small, but sad smile graced Yoongi's lips. He got up and walked over, wrapping his pale arms around your figure and resting his head on top of yours. He kissed your hair and played with your soft locks, buying his face into the crook of your neck. ""When I get back, I promise...""

You smiled. ""I know.""

""I love you.""

""I know that too.""

""Say it back.""

You laughed at his neediness. ""I love you, Yoongi-ah.""

Suga grunted an approval, tightening his hug before resuming his place to finish breakfast. The both of you ate in comfortable silence, enjoying each other's company and the aroma of strong coffee. He finishes his breakfast before you do, and you leave the plates on the table to follow him, helping him pack stuff that he tend to forget (""Your laptop charger, Yoongi. For God's sake"").

When it was time to leave, Yoongi reluctantly dragged himself to the front door. Pulling you into a one-armed hug, Suga kissed you gently on the forehead and murmured, ""I'll see you when I get back, and I'll call whenever I can.""

You nodded and kissed him solidly on the lips. ""Take care of yourself and the boys.""

Suga nodded and stepped out into the hallway. Before you can close the door, he turned around and graced you with that heart-stopping wink, with his lips split wide into his trademark gummy smile.

""Oh, by the way, you should always wear my clothes when I'm around.""

You looked down at your attire in confusion and blinked in surprise. You hadn't realized that the 'shorts' were actually his boxers, and that the t-shirt wasn't yours either. By the time you looked back up, your boyfriend had already stepped into the elevator, his smug cackles echoing after his footsteps. You rolled your eyes and closed the door behind you, shaking your head at his attempts to be smooth. It was sad that they work every time though.

Standing alone in your living room, you wrapped your arms around yourself and smiled.

They were more comfortable than your own clothes anyway.

You come back into the flat, it’s been a long day at work, but an even longer day as you haven’t seen your boyfriend for over 12 hours. He had left for work before your first shift started, and would be home a few hours before you. Sometimes you wondered when you would see each other, his job was very demanding; being the president of a high-end record label often forced Yoongi to take business trips that lasted for days, while you labored over your meager paying waiter job at the local diner.

So, when you walk in to a dark candlelit setting you are surprised, to say the least. Yoongi was never the type to express his feelings, especially not feelings of love or romance. He was more of the dominating person, you just knew that he cared, although you suspected his feelings for you when he would turn a blind eye towards you and focus more on his work.

“Y/N, welcome home.” You hear his voice float towards you, but it’s so dark, save for the candlelight, that you can’t tell where it’s coming from. You blindly walk to the kitchen, keeping your hands on the wall, because everyone knows you are actually blind at night. And somehow, you stumble in on Yoongi dressed in a suit, complete with a checkered tabletop covered in food, candles and flowers. It’s your dream romantic setup, except you never imagined you being able to reenact this cliché with someone, Yoongi of all people; not that you didn’t love him with all your heart, it was just, he never seemed the romantic type.

You looked confused at the food, pointing at it with your jaw dropped, while Yoongi just looks at it and smirks, “Don’t look at me I didn’t cook, hyung cooked it for us.” He sits you down, you looking like an underdressed blubbering idiot, when Yoongi puts his fingers to your lips.

“This is as much as for you as it is for me Y/N. You could wear anything honestly, and this dinner would still be perfect.” Yoongi hushes you and continues, as you try to object. “It doesn’t matter what you are wearing because, all I need is you to be here for this dinner to be perfect. If you want, I could go back and change into more normal clothes so you feel less out of pla–“ You vehemently shake your head, you like seeing Yoongi in a suit; it makes him look crisp, handsome, beautiful, and you realize how perfect your boyfriend is.

Both of you eat the dinner Seokjin supposedly cooked, as you two make small talk. You realize how much you’ve missed this; between both of your busy work schedules, you never have time to really talk. Things like the weather and politics become irrelevant when usually the only thing on your minds is being with each other, as close you can be physically, in the small amount of time that you two actually see each other.

And then you realize that that’s why Yoongi is doing this. The dinner is his way of making up to you the lost time and his long business trips away from you. You realize that between those unspoken words in the short times you do see each other is his declaration of love for you. Yoongi was always a man of little word, always thinking that actions spoke louder than words, and maybe this time he was right.

You both talk for what seems like hours, the food is long gone, until Yoongi sees you stretching your arms out and yawning, not from boredom, but from tiredness.

“Y/N, let’s get you to bed, huh.” Yoongi says in a purely platonic, sweet way. He’s not looking to make love to you tonight, he just wants to make you feel loved and make sure you get a good night’s rest. He wants you to know that a good night between the two of you doesn’t have to end in sex, but can end with the two of you falling asleep in each others arms.

You both change into your pajamas, and as you both lay down in your bed, Yoongi pulls you into his arms. You both are facing each other, and he first kisses your forehead. He touches both of your eyelids with his lips, tracing them down to the tip of your nose, where he rests his lips for a second before lightly licking it. You yelp and he chuckles as you scrunch your face at the wet sensation. You try to wipe your nose with the back of your hand but Yoongi pins your hand behind you, he’s in control, even when he’s not trying to be. He kisses both of your cheeks, trailing his lips to the corner of your mouth and you shiver at the light contact. Not giving you the kiss you crave, he buries his face in the crook of your neck, just clutching you. You feel him moving his lips, and as you focus on the movement, you realize that he is mouthing “I love you” all over your skin.

You clutch the back of his neck and bring him back up to your lips. He captures your lips in the sweetest way, lightly pressing upon your lips. There isn’t any tongue involved, in fact he pulls away when you try to take over the kiss. He looks at you sternly, and can’t resist pecking at your pout once more, before resting his forehead onto yours.

“I love you Y/N, you know that right?” Yoongi breathes across your lips and you shudder, not only because of the way his breath feels across your lips, but also because this is one of the rare moments in which Yoongi has told you that he loves you. You happily sigh and he turns you around so the two of you are spooning. Your legs are tangled together, and though he may be short, he still is half a head taller than you.

You can feel his head slightly resting upon yours and how he slightly tightens his grip on you as he whispers above you, “Good night baby, I’m taking tomorrow off so we can spend more time together. Sleep well, you’ll need the rest for what we’re going to do.“ You can hear the smirk in his voice as he continues. “I’m in love with you and honestly I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have your warmth, if I didn’t see your blinding smile, or hear your dazzling laugh. I may rarely say it, but I fucking love you to death baby.”

He doesn’t see it, but your smile is so wide, and you exhale “I love you Yoongi” back to him, as he kisses the top of your head. Content at the turn the night had taken, you fall asleep like this, to Yoongi’s steady breathing and calm heartbeat, the two of you entwined in each other.

Un beta'd, mainly because I wrote this for the person that I usually get to beta for me.

Merry Christmas!!!

Yoongi woke up to the sound of excited feet running down the hall towards his room. He blinked open his eyes just before his door burst open, his seemingly overjoyed boyfriend running in decked out in a baggy holiday sweater. The grayscale snowmen stitched onto the fabric looked like they were bouncing with every single ragged breath Jungkook took as he ran up, jumping into the bed next to Yoongi.

“Merry Christmas!” Jungkook yelled, wrapping his arms around Yoongi’s waist just a little too tight. Yoongi laughed lightly, running a tired hand through the boy’s hair.

“Is it breakfast time?” Yoongi asked, his voice still hoarse from sleep and a yawn still fighting it’s way through his body. Jungkook bit his lip, looking up at his boyfriend sheepishly.

“Well… I mean you’ve been really busy. And you haven’t been sleeping enough… so I thought I should let you sleep. But then it started snowing and I didn’t feel like waiting any longer.” Yoongi smiled sweetly, pressing a tentative kiss to Jungkook’s forehead. Even then, two years into their relationship, any form of kissing made both of them nervous. But this was a special exception.

“What time is it baby?” He asked groggily, rubbing the sleep from his eyes a little awkwardly. Jungkook laughed, a feeling that reverberated warmly through Yoongi’s chest.

“It’s only two, you’re fine. I did make breakfast though! Or, I’m in the middle of making breakfast. Come down when you’re ready, okay?” Jungkook gave Yoongi a big squeeze before detangling himself from the older boy and bounding back out the door. Yoongi couldn’t help but smile. He could hear his boyfriend downstairs in the kitchen singing loudly to some Christmas song. It was the first day Yoongi had off in at least a month. Christmas Day actually. And Jungkook had been so sweet and supportive through the last busy month but, Yoongi knew it made him sad. They’d been together for two years but it still felt like when they had first started dating. Every day apart was somehow an eternity.

But today was going to be special. Yoongi pulled himself up out of his bed, not even bothering to put on a shirt as he padded through the room towards his work bag. He knew that the one place he could ever get away with hiding something from Jungkook would be there, and after a minute of rustling he finds it. Yoongi takes a deep breath, trying to steady himself before he follows the sound of his boyfriend’s voice down the stairs to the kitchen.

He stops just inside the door frame, taking a moment to drink in his boyfriend. Jungkook is beautiful. Everyone always said that once you could see colors everything would change, and everything somehow became even more beautiful. But Yoongi called bullshit. No amount of color could make the raven haired boy more beautiful. Jungkook’s hair was so dark in comparison to the rest of his features, except for his eyes. They were always dark but, still smiling. Always smiling.

Yoongi coughed a little, making Jungkook turn around and give him that smile. That stupid little bunny smile that always made Yoongi’s heart feel like a Christmas tree.

“Kookie um… I want to try something.” He mumbled out, pulling the little sprig of mistletoe out from behind his back and holding it above his head. He felt stupid, but this was easier than asking out loud. “Merry Christmas.” He said, but it sounded more like a scared question.

There was a moment of silence. Jungkook looked at him, eyes wide and mouth hanging open just a little bit. Yoongi silently cursed himself for ever even suggesting it. They’d started dating and fallen in love fast… so fast that when it finally occurred to them that they might not even be soul mates it was already too late. They were already in too deep, and neither one of them wanted the answer to be no. So they just hadn’t kissed. Not really at least.

Jungkook cocked his head to the side, stepping closer to Yoongi who was biting his lip nervously. Jungkook looked down at him, shyly at first, before reaching out to cup Yoongi’s cheek in his hand.

“This doesn’t change anything. Okay? I love you. I want to be with you. Only you.” Jungkook said, his voice shaking almost imperceptibly, but Yoongi noticed. Yoongi always noticed.

“I don’t care if you’re not my soulmate. Okay? I promise. I love you so much Kookie.” Yoongi mumbled, not even looking up at the boy out of shyness. Instead he opted for wrapping his arms around the younger boy’s waist. He could feel it more than hear it when Jungkook took a deep breath, tilting Yoongi’s chin up so he was facing the younger boy.

“Are you ready?” Jungkook whispered, nervous excitement dancing behind his eyes. Yoongi only nodded, trying to calm his now racing heart.

It wasn’t what he expected. It was better than anything he thought it would be. Jungkook’s lips pressed against his and he couldn’t help but smile because it felt so right. So complete. If nature was a person he had found that person. It was Jungkook. A chaotic hurricane of emotion, a beautiful sun-kissed day, the electricity in the air just before a thunderstorm, he’d found it. He’d found it all and more wrapped up in this beautiful human being before him. And now that person was kissing him.

He pulled away slowly, a little bit scared of opening his eyes. He blinked them open slowly, letting out a quiet gasp as he did. Before him stood the most beautiful man he’d ever seen in his life. His hair wasn’t black at all, it was this beautiful deep color that looked like cherries smelled and that lit up even under the pathetic fluorescent lighting of their shitty kitchen. His cheeks were tinted with the color he could only imagine a rose would be, getting darker under Yoongi’s stare.

“Hyung?” Jungkook asked tentatively after a moment, biting into his lip with a smile. God those lips looked the way sunshine felt. “Are you crying?”

Yoongi laughed, shaking his head vehemently as he wiped at his eyes, not wanting to look away from Jungkook for even a second.

“I’m fine. I’m fine. Just, kiss me again?” He asked sheepishly, still unwilling to tear his gaze away from his beautiful boyfriend. Jungkook laughed, pulling the older boy back into his arms.

“Anything for you. Soulmate.”

Merry Christmas."

I think I wrote this early last year, but I never bothered to finish it :D then I found it in my email drafts a few days ago so I figured why not just post this and see how it goes ;;

I hope you enjoy?? If you like it I'll try to continue <3

“I like smart cars, do you like smart cars?” Someone appears next to him, bouncing happily on the balls of his feet. Jungkook glances warily at the stranger. He's on his way to calculus, and he's never seen this guy's shock of orange hair anywhere before.

He says, “Um.”

The stranger continues, gesturing wildly with his hands, “They're small and cute and efficient and they're so easy to park you have no idea.” He pauses to catch his breath. “And parking is a big issue when you have a '80s sedan like me. Like, ugh.” The stranger sighs and looks at Jungkook expectantly.

“Um,” he says again, “smart cars sound very convenient.” They stop walking outside a classroom, and the stranger beams a squarish smile that shows all his teeth.

“Right? This is my classroom,” the stranger gestures behind himself. “Are you taking calculus too? I'm Taehyung by the way.” Taehyung doesn't wait for an answer and just seizes Jungkook's hand to vigorously shake, before hopping into the classroom and seating himself loudly right in front of the professor. Jungkook follows him into the classroom and takes his usual seat in the middle. Not close enough to see the professor's nose hairs, but not far enough to get away with snoring like a lion. Not that Jungkook would even try to nap - classes are very important. But Jungkook has never seen this Taehyung guy in class before, nor anywhere else on campus. Huh.

Taehyung bugs the professor during the entire lesson.

“Prof! You have a calculation error in that last step!”
“Prof! You have a hair sticking up at two-thirds radians!”
“Prof! You forgot to dot that 'i'!”

Jungkook is surprised when the professor gives Taehyung a chupachup after the bell.

His surprise must show on his face, because the kid next to him laughs at him on his way out.

“Jungkook, right? The super freshman who's taking a load of sophomore classes?” This stranger has a distinct eye smile and a strange but friendly accent.

“Um, yeah,” Jungkook has no classes after this, so he can spare a few minutes. “I'm a freshman, but I wouldn't say super.”

“Don't be modest,” the stranger laughs and shakes Jungkook's offered hand. “I'm Jimin. Park Jimin. You must be wondering about Taehyung.”

Ah, yes. Taehyung. “He's odd. I'm new here, but he doesn't seem new? But I haven't seen him before.” Jungkook isn't very articulate.

“He was just released from the hospital yesterday,” Jimin clarifies. “I'm gonna catch a burger with him now, you wanna come?”

Jungkook is morbidly hungry, and sort of confused. Taehyung must have been in the hospital for ages if he missed over two months of classes. The professor finishes his conversation with a happy Taehyung, who then proceeds to skip to the door and drape himself over Jimin.

“I'm so hungry I could eat seventeen burgers!” He exclaims. “And nine sodas and twelve pizzas! Maybe.” Jungkook is following the pair of sophomores like a lost puppy for free food. Will it be free? Jungkook hopes so.

Taehyung continues, “Actually I lied, I don't think I can eat that much. But Prof Mark hasn't changed a bit, still so seriously boring.” He flaps his arms indignantly.

Jimin laughs as they take a seat in a window booth of the burger shack. “You're just too excited to be out of the hospital, man. How are your ribs?”

Jungkook glances between Taehyung and Jimin, and decides to sit next to Jimin. He's more normal.

“I was fine a long time ago! I don't know why they kept me there for so long,” Taehyung complains with a pout. They order several burgers and a milkshake each.

Jimin chuckles and sits back with his hands behind his head. “Well you already finished all your work for the semester, right? You don't even need to come to class.”

“I don't, but I came because I know you guys miss me,” Taehyung flutters his eyelashes at Jimin and begins stuffing his first burger into his face. “Also, the Professors must have been so depressed with you poor excuses for attentive students.”

Jimin shoves a burger in Jungkook's direction before picking up one for himself. “Taehyungie got himself squashed under a tree when we went snowboarding awhile ago.” He says between chews. “It was both the most amazing and scariest thing I have ever seen. He was giggling in the ambulance.”

Jungkook pauses mid-chew to stare at Taehyung in a new light. This guy was even weirder than he originally thought. “Um, this burger is pretty cool. I mean, you are pretty cool.”

They chat awhile about snowboarding and class and Jungkook. He answers their endless questions: “Yeah, I'm sure I'm a freshman. No, I've never been snowboarding before, but it sounds… Exhilarating. I'm a graphic design major. Yes, I do need to get home soon. Sorry.”

Jungkook doesn't have many friends. He goes to class, listens to the professor, then he goes home to do homework. He doesn't really have time for friends. But these two are intriguing. They dropped into his life like splashes of neon glow-in-the-dark paint on a white canvas. He can't tell if that's good or bad.

“You're later than usual, Jungkookie,” one of his roommates calls from the living room, where he's getting owned by the computer player at Wii tennis.

Jungkook drops his backpack on the dining table and pulls out two burgers he had packed for his roommates. “Hi, Yugyeom. I went to eat with… Some friends? Some people I met.” He doesn't really know. “So this is for you. I'm gonna go work on stuff.”

His roommate is delighted. “Friends!” The computer scores again as he squeals, distracted, “You should totally have them over sometime! And your poster is finished drying on the rack,” he adds.

Jungkook nods and makes his way to his room. As he's finishing up another project and two papers, he thinks about Taehyung and Jimin. Jimin is a traditional literature major. He spouts random quotes that Jungkook has trouble relating to the conversation. Jimin smiles like a cat and purrs like one too. His accent is almost adorable, but Jungkook isn't quite sure about using that word on a guy. Taehyung is a psychology major. His dream is to be a children's doctor. (“So he can be the kid he is under the guise of ""interacting” with them,“ Jimin had said, shaking his head at Taehyung building a fort out of the burger wrappers.) He likes spontaneity.

Despite the strangeness, Jungkook thinks he likes them."

Things like the weather and politics become irrelevant when usually the only thing on your minds is being with each other, as close you can be physically, in the small amount of time that you two actually see each other.

And then you realize that that’s why Yoongi is doing this. The dinner is his way of making up to you the lost time and his long business trips away from you. You realize that between those unspoken words in the short times you do see each other is his declaration of love for you. Yoongi was always a man of little word, always thinking that actions spoke louder than words, and maybe this time he was right.

You both talk for what seems like hours, the food is long gone, until Yoongi sees you stretching your arms out and yawning, not from boredom, but from tiredness.

“Y/N, let’s get you to bed, huh.” Yoongi says in a purely platonic, sweet way. He’s not looking to make love to you tonight, he just wants to make you feel loved and make sure you get a good night’s rest. He wants you to know that a good night between the two of you doesn’t have to end in sex, but can end with the two of you falling asleep in each others arms.

You both change into your pajamas, and as you both lay down in your bed, Yoongi pulls you into his arms. You both are facing each other, and he first kisses your forehead. He touches both of your eyelids with his lips, tracing them down to the tip of your nose, where he rests his lips for a second before lightly licking it. You yelp and he chuckles as you scrunch your face at the wet sensation. You try to wipe your nose with the back of your hand but Yoongi pins your hand behind you, he’s in control, even when he’s not trying to be. He kisses both of your cheeks, trailing his lips to the corner of your mouth and you shiver at the light contact. Not giving you the kiss you crave, he buries his face in the crook of your neck, just clutching you. You feel him moving his lips, and as you focus on the movement, you realize that he is mouthing “I love you” all over your skin.

You clutch the back of his neck and bring him back up to your lips. He captures your lips in the sweetest way, lightly pressing upon your lips. There isn’t any tongue involved, in fact he pulls away when you try to take over the kiss. He looks at you sternly, and can’t resist pecking at your pout once more, before resting his forehead onto yours.

“I love you Y/N, you know that right?” Yoongi breathes across your lips and you shudder, not only because of the way his breath feels across your lips, but also because this is one of the rare moments in which Yoongi has told you that he loves you. You happily sigh and he turns you around so the two of you are spooning. Your legs are tangled together, and though he may be short, he still is half a head taller than you.

You can feel his head slightly resting upon yours and how he slightly tightens his grip on you as he whispers above you, “Good night baby, I’m taking tomorrow off so we can spend more time together. Sleep well, you’ll need the rest for what we’re going to do.“ You can hear the smirk in his voice as he continues. “I’m in love with you and honestly I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have your warmth, if I didn’t see your blinding smile, or hear your dazzling laugh. I may rarely say it, but I fucking love you to death baby.”

He doesn’t see it, but your smile is so wide, and you exhale “I love you Yoongi” back to him, as he kisses the top of your head. Content at the turn the night had taken, you fall asleep like this, to Yoongi’s steady breathing and calm heartbeat, the two of you entwined in each other.

Unconditional and eternal, such are imaginary friends, and that was well known by the young Min Yoongi, who at 6 years old was apparently playing alone in the small courtyard of his grandmother's house.

It wasn’t a secret to anyone in his family that, although Yoongi had several friends, his favorite was Namjoon. With whom he was at that moment.
Namjoon was Yoongi's imaginary friend, a boy a year younger than him, as mischievous as any child and a faithful best friend. He had been there for almost three years, and despite his early age, Yoongi could say that one of the things that made him the happiest was his friend's dimpled smile.

During the following years, the bond that connected the two boys never broke. No matter how many friends came to Yoongi’s life, none of them took the place of Namjoon, making what they had much more special. After all, imaginary friends were unconditional and eternal. Or that was what 6 years old Yoongi believed, because after turning 11 and as his interest in music started growing after Namjoon encouraged him to learn about it, adding the problems that were starting to appear in his family, Namjoon was taking a back seat in his life.

Clearly it was something gradual, at first Yoongi stopped talking to him when they were on the street, causing the poor Namjoon to feel uncomfortable, although he never said a word about that. The next thing was to withdraw him the word when his family was there, because apparently having an imaginary friend was a childish thing. When Yoongi turned 12, Namjoon barely showed up, ever, when he was most depressed, he could hear his friend talking to him and sometimes he even saw his gentle dimpled smile, but one day even that disappeared.

Namjoon became no more than a memory of the past, and as Yoongi grew and his problems accumulated, there was no room for him in his memory anymore.
At the age of 18 and after several disputes with her parents, Yoongi auditioned for an idol company, Big Hit, with the sole purpose of becoming a music producer, to fulfill his dream of making his own music and getting people to listen to it. Against all odds, he not only managed to be a producer and composer, but he was given the opportunity to be himself who transmitted his music, which, to that boy who finally seemed to see the light at the end of the tunnel, it didn’t bother him, as long as he could stay true to himself. It was then, shortly after being admitted into the project called 방탄 소년단, when he met that boy.

Kim Namjoon, a 17-year-old boy with the desire of bringing his music to the people, a tall boy with a deep voice and beautiful dimples that adorned his cheeks.

The first time Yoongi saw Namjoon he couldn’t stop doing it, there was something about that boy that was incredibly familiar, to the extent of filling his heart with nostalgia and longing that he couldn’t situate. The following days weren’t much better, that feeling had lodged in his heart to stay, apparently permanently, and sometimes even annoying him. Imagine feeling that you should know a person that, no matter how hard you try, you don’t remember. To have the feeling that they has been in your life, but not knowing when. Feel calm when looking at their eyes or their smile as if that person were a calmative despite not knowing anything about them. That was the situation Min Yoongi was experiencing every day since he met Namjoon, who didn’t seem to feel the same way. He never said anything similar to what was going through Yoongi's mind when he looked at him, after all, it was normal, Namjoon had grown up in Ilsan, while Yoongi had lived in Daegu, they couldn’t had met before.

Yoongi decided to bury all those feelings and ignore them, allowing new ones to appear, they began as a slight admiration towards the child. Both had stayed together over the years, watching some members left while new ones entered. They shared ideas, advice and helped each other, although it was usually Yoongi who would lend a hand to Namjoon, at least at first.

The friendship they’ve created between them was strange, in the eyes of their fans it could seem more distant than the one they had with other members, however, it was a strong friendship, one of those that you know will last. The only flaw it had in Yoongi's eyes was precisely that it was just a friendship.

It had been 7 years since the day he met Namjoon, 7 years during which he had shared house, studio and stages with him, 7 years in which the feelings he had at first were hidden by new ones that had gradually gone growing to the point of being impossible to hide. It was that night, after their last concert of the Wings tour when everything started to fall apart.

Yoongi had managed to maintain a more or less stable mood during the last year, he had improved and could even say that he felt happy, but sometimes he just fell apart. After arriving at the apartment after the concert, he could feel how every cell of his body was asking for rest, his mood was somehow affected by being the last concert and as soon as he collapsed on the bed, it came all over in the form of muffled sobs against the pillow. At that moment the room’s door opened and a warm hand stroked his head. Yoongi barely raised his face to see Namjoon's dimples between his hair and tears. At that moment, the feelings he had buried years ago came back, making the tears warmer, filling his heart and highlighting the new feelings he had created during that time.

""Finally, you remember me,"" Namjoon muttered, prompting Yoongi to throw himself into Namjoon’s arms.

Unconditional and eternal, such are imaginary friends, and that was well known to Min Yoongi, who at 24 was in the arms of Namjoon, the boy with the precious dimples that had accompanied him all his life, and who was more real than ever."

The meaning of Love Yourself Tear is basically displaying that in love itself, there are some dark times and that can lead to tears and sadness. Also that love is a very complex thing to handle and to work out, so BTS wanted to focus on the sad times of love and the parts of love that they want to run away from.

RM also went on to express about loving yourself as a person. Basically displaying that if you won't or aren't true to yourself, then that love won't last, which will bring you down. Also that love can be between a person and another person but it could also be between you and yourself as a person.

They also said about how why they are advocating different types of love. They revealed that they want to give positivity back to us - ARMY - because we always show them the love and affection they need to get through the tough times of being an idol.

RM explained that sometimes, they feel like they truly get so much love - more then they deserve in their eyes. So they wanted to give back the love to ARMY who give them so much love to make them carry on as a group. Because he explained that love isn't a resource that should be thrown around, that love needs to be treated right.

2. Singularity - Taehyung

Summary for the Chapter:

This chapter will display the lyrics of Singularity and my theory on what it actually means.

{Verse 1}
A sound of something breaking
I awake from sleep
A sound full of unfamiliarity
Try to cover my ears but I can't go to sleep

{Pre-Chorus}
The pain in my throat gets worse
Try to cover it
I don't have a voice
Today I hear that sound again

{Chorus}
It's ringing again, that sound
A crack again on this frozen lake
I dumped myself into the lake
I buried my voice for you
Over the winter lake I was thrown

{Verse 2}
A thick ice has formed
In the dream I shortly went into
My agonizing phantom pain is still the same
Have I lost myself?

{Pre-Chorus}
Or have I gained you?
I suddenly run to the lake
There's my face in it
Please don't say anything

{Chorus}
Reach my hand out to cover the mouth
But in the end, spring will come someday
The ice will melt and flow away
Tell me if my voice isn't real

{Chorus}
If I shouldn't have thrown myself away
Tell me if even this pain isn't real
What was I supposed to do back then?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My Explanation:

Verse 1:

Taehyung is dancing with an item of girls clothing in the beginning, and the lyrics are saying that he has just woke up from some sort of coma type thing, meaning that he hears something breaking in the distance and then hears the sound of unfamiliarity. He describes that he wants to go back to 'sleep' but he can't seem to block out the noise that he hears.

Pre-Chorus:

Taehyung is explaining that he has a pain in his throat that is getting worse and worse as time goes on, him trying to cover the pain that would come across his face. Then him saying that he doesn't have a voice - making me think if he has lost it or someone is telling him not to use it. In the last line, he says that he hears the same sound of unfamiliarity from before.

Chorus:

For this part of the song, Taehyung explains that the same sound is ringing again, making a crack appear again on some frozen lake, then he goes on to say that he dumped himself in the lake for someone, burring his voice deep into the lake. In the last line, he goes on to say that over the winter, he was thrown into the lake, displaying that someone doesn't like him or maybe he is sacrificing himself for someone.

Verse 2:

For Verse 2, Taehyung says that a thick layer of ice has formed, in the dream I shortly went into. This explains to me that he went into a dream and got out, but a thick layer of ice forms over it, to maybe make Taehyung forget about that dream. Then he goes on to saying that his agonizing phantom of pain is still the same as when he woke up, himself questioning if he has lost himself in the dream he once was in.

Pre-Chorus:

For the second pre-chorus, Taehyung asks if he has gained someone inside of him, meaning to me that he has lost someone close to him and is questioning if that person is looking over him. Then he goes into saying that he suddenly runs to the lake to see his face and pleads for someone to not say anything about himself seeing his face in the lake. Meaning Taehyung sees it as some kind of sin.

Last two chorus's:

For the last two chorus's, I combined them. For the first one, Taehyung explains that he covers his mouth with his hand, but in the end spring will come some day. This explains to me that, he has some sort of secret or some sort of love towards winter, but he realises the spring will come some day. Then he explains that the ice will melt and flow away, meaning that when spring comes, himself or his voice will be set free. Then he says tell me if my voice isn't real as kind of if he wants his voice to not be real so he can't hear it anymore.

For the last chorus, he asks if he shouldn't have thrown himself away into the lake, almost as if he is regretting ever throwing and loosing his voice. Then he says for someone to tell him if even the pain he was feeling isn't real, if it is all in his imagination, kind of displaying some sort of hallucinations or some sort of mental health. For the very last line, Taehyung asks what was he meant to do back then when all of it happened. This kind of displaying that he had no clue what he was doing and how to save himself back then when it happened.

All together:

What this means all together is that he is saying that he was thrown into a lake and buried his voice for someone, maybe because that person didn't like them and wanted Taehyung to change? It is also displaying to me personally that Taehyung is willing to change for the love of his life, but then he is sad because he will change himself only for winter, and when spring comes the lake will melt and he will go back to the way he was...

“We broke up.”

Namjoon heard him the first time, loud and clear, with no distractions because he always gave Jeongguk a 110% of his attention. Yet, the confession threw him off, jumbled up his brain because he thought he was mistaken. He must have heard wrong. They were sitting on Jeongguk’s bed with a movie playing on the laptop between them. Maybe Namjoon mixed up what Jeongguk and one of the film characters had said.

He uttered, “Huh?” and Jeongguk gave one of those soft laughs that sounded exhausted, like he didn’t know what other noise to make.

“We broke up,” Jeongguk repeated, a little bit louder, and he shrugged like it was nothing. “Officially. It was last night, we were on the phone for a long time.”

A few days ago, Jeongguk had mentioned he and Yoongi were “ discussing some things.” Namjoon didn’t know what that entailed, but he gave Jeongguk his best wishes. He didn’t think that their talk would lead to a break-up. Now he wasn’t sure what to say because there were too many things he wanted to spill.

But first, he asked, “Are you okay?” Finally Jeongguk looked at him, smile faint but there. He shrugged again.

“I think so. I mean, yeah,” Jeongguk said, his laugh now awkward. “I can’t say I’m surprised we did. We’ve been kind of, I don’t know, it hasn’t been feeling like anything for a while. Like, it hasn’t been feeling right to me or something.”

You weren’t being treated fairly , Namjoon wanted to say, because he knew Jeongguk too well, and had observed the situation from far away to know enough. He wasn’t treating you the same. He wasn’t acting like an actual boyfriend.

Jeongguk’s hands were resting in his lap, but in the next moment they were clasped warmly with Namjoon’s. Jeongguk glanced down again, leaning some so his bangs covered his eyes.

“It’s just weird because, we’re still friends, I guess. We decided on that because it felt weird to not to be friends, but it also feels weird to be friends. And then like, I’ve been off social media for a while because I, maybe this is bad but, I hated seeing him and his other boyfriend on there so much.” Jeongguk gripped Namjoon’s hands a little tighter as his brain churned out the words he really wanted, needed, to say. “Yoongi never . . . he’s always treated Taehyung differently. I feel like he’s always treated him better than me? He always went far and beyond for Taehyung but when it came to me, he did half that, if barely.”

It was more than Jeongguk was ready to admit, because he looked up at Namjoon sharply, mouth tight and eyes rounder than usual. His eyes were shiny like tears were piled up, but nothing spilled, and Jeongguk’s voice stayed clear. “He’s told people we broke up because we just don’t feel the same way for each other anymore. And yeah, I guess so. But it’s so, so much more than that.”

When Namjoon and Jeongguk first met a year ago, Jeongguk was in a polyamorous relationship with Yoongi. Namjoon had never met Yoongi in person, though, as Jeongguk and Yoongi were long distance. Yoongi had another boyfriend, Taehyung, at the time, as well. But Taehyung and Jeongguk were only friends.

Namjoon’s view on Yoongi was complex from the beginning. He only knew of Yoongi through some retellings of troubles shared by Jeongguk. This normally ended with Jeongguk trying to pass off the issues as “ not too serious . I’m probably overthinking it. Don’t mind me. ” The rest Namjoon found out by looking into Yoongi’s social media, as the curiosity was too strong to ignore. Namjoon discovered he didn’t care much for Yoongi, but he kept those feelings to himself.

It didn’t change once Namjoon and Jeongguk officially got together.

Wetness clung to Jeongguk’s eyelashes, and he brought up his and Namjoon’s clasped hands so he could rest his forehead on them. “It wasn’t the same like with me and you,” Jeongguk said.

Namjoon waited a moment before he untangled their hands and cupped Jeongguk’s cheeks. The tip of Jeongguk’s nose and his eyes were tinted red, but he still didn’t cry, only gave Namjoon a sullen look. “I’m sorry,” Jeongguk mumbled.

“What for?” Namjoon stroked his cheeks with his thumbs, causing Jeongguk to close his eyes. “You don’t have anything to be sorry about. What you’re feeling isn’t wrong. And honestly,” he drifted off, not sure if now was appropriate to confess his true thoughts.

He always felt a little uncertain about Yoongi and Jeongguk’s relationship. Couldn’t help but notice how differently Yoongi treated Taehyung and Jeongguk. Namjoon never mentioned anything, because it didn’t feel like his place to, and he didn’t want to offend Jeongguk. It didn’t feel right to say much when he didn’t know the entire story. He would only discuss their relationship if Jeongguk brought it up first.

Mostly, Namjoon didn’t know how to discuss his concerns with Jeongguk.

“I meant it when I said I hope you and him work out a solution that was best for the both of you,” Namjoon continued, and Jeongguk nodded lightly. “And your happiness matters. I’m fully supportive of you, and I’m always here to listen if you want to talk more about the situation, Yoongi, whatever. You deserve only good things. Please don’t feel sorry about anything.”

Namjoon kissed his forehead, lips trailing down his nose until they landed a soft kiss on his lips. Jeongguk couldn’t help but chuckle, face now red because of a shy blush and not because he was on the verge of crying. His hands covered Namjoon’s again, and everything inside Namjoon dropped and rose again when Jeongguk smiled at him.

He couldn’t hold back the enormous glee and fondness overflowing him. “You’re so cute and I love you,” and then he kissed Jeongguk again, muffling his laughter. “I love you.”

All they did for minutes was kiss, slow and chaste, and somewhere in between Jeongguk said, “Thank you so much. I love you, too.”"

He stood only a few steps away from the door frame, gazing at the porch coated in silver moonlight, laced with an endless cobweb of shadows.

His eyes shifted towards the dark path which led to the vast forest and even vaster world beyond.

The whisper of the nearby flowing river and the humming of the crickets echoed throughout the chilly night as the time to depart for his journey had arrived.

He slowly turned around to look at his lover for one final time before he left.

The young man was sleeping peacefully on the layers of white blankets, his chest subtly and calmly heaving up and down, up and down... Those soft orange locks falling over his forehead and those plump lips slightly parted...

The boy with doe eyes threw a glance at the goodbye-letter he placed on the wooden floor next to the pile of blankets.

He clutched the old leather strap of the bag filled with necessities and turned on his heel.

The moment he did that...

...Chaos replaced silence.

Suddenly all of the trees surrounding the small cabin began attacking it under the command of the strong and vicious wind. Their branches kept clawing against the roof and walls, leaves scattering in a deadly whirlpool while the piercing howl of the wind grew louder and louder with each snatched leaf.

Shit, I better get going before―

“Jungkook-ah.”

He froze before even taking a single step towards the door...

It seemed that everything else also froze at the sound of the boy's voice.

The wind disappeared.

The trees stood still.

All the leaves soundlessly fell to the ground.

Jeon Jungkook reluctantly turned to face the person who spoke his name.

He was sitting sideways, staring at him with large, concerned eyes.

“Don't leave,” he breathed at last.

Unable to hold his gaze, Jungkook found himselflooking down towards the bag in his hand.

“I have to,” he said quietly, unsure if the words even reached the other boy.

“Kook-ah, please,” he quickly unwrapped the covers from his body and was about to stand up, but felt the all too familiar dizziness weighing him down.

With eyes squeezed shut, he simply steadied himself by rooting his fist to the floor. “If you set out on this dangerous quest...” the boy opened his eyes, “You will perish.”

Without any hesitation Jungkook swiftly made his way toward his lover, casting away the bag and kneeling before him.

“But if I don't, then you will,” he said as he cupped the orange-haired boy's face with his hands.

“Jimin, I'll be fine. I can do this. Just give me five days,” he assured him for the umpteenth time, gently caressing his cheeks with his thumbs.

Jimin lay his hands on top of Jungkook's warm ones and took them down in his lap, holding them firmly. “Alright,” he made a slight nod, considering his next words. “Alright. Since I obviously can't convince you to stay, then take me with you, Kook-ah.” He pleaded, desperately searching for any last hope remaining in his lover's eyes.

“Take me with you!” he raised his voice. “If I hadn't told you about my condition, you would have never found out in the first place and now I wouldn't have to spend my remaining days alone! Please, Kook-ah...”

But despite all of Jimin's anguish, Jungkook only shook his head, gazing down at their hands.

“Don't be selfish, hyung,” he said. “I'd have to spend my entire lifetime alone, if I don't fulfill this quest. And don't underestimate me. I understand how you feel, but you need to believe me when I promise you that I will come back, safe and sound.” Jungkook lifted his head and his eyes traveled along the features of the orange-haired boy. “I'm better off on my own, because you'll only be a burden, Prince Jimin―

“Don't call me that.” The boy's voice broke as he snarled and subconsciously tightened the grip on Jungkook's hands. He felt the stinging in his eyes and the blurring of his sight. He knew very well what followed, so he turned his face away and gradually let go of the dark-haired boy's hands.

But Jungkook also knew, so he placed his hand on the back of Jimin's neck, hauled him forward, and crashed their lips together.

Although passionate the kiss was also filled with fear and sadness and bitterness.

They've never shared a farewell-kiss before.

But it was only regarded as such.

The kiss was actually a seal of Jungkook's promise.

It sealed the fact that he would undoubtedly return and save him and kiss him again and again.

Jimin was the one who slowly pulled away as he couldn't hold his whimper anymore.

Their lips were now brushing against each other and Jungkook felt the tiny shuddering breaths which escaped Jimin's mouth.

The dark-haired boy opened his eyes and saw them. After instantly pressing their lips together for the second time, he tasted them too...

Jimin's tears of blood.

Jungkook had seen them many times before because they fell spontaneously; not only when Jimin was emotional.

Nevertheless, this was definitely a kiss they've never shared before.

Jungkook stuck out his tongue, tenderly licking Jimin's trembling, salty lips and admiring that silky, orange hair between his fingers.

After a moment both their tongues met; soft, wet and burning; grazing along each other, spreading the taste of iron.

As they eventually broke the kiss, Jungkook breathlessly gazed at the traces of scarlet tears falling from Jimin's crescent eyes.

He simply linked their foreheads together as he kept stroking his lover's hair. “Five days,” he whispered. “I'll see you in five days,” he gave his word before planting another fiery kiss on Jimin's lips and getting up on his feet in a hurry.

He took the bag from the floor and threw it over his shoulder, heading for the door.

“Jungkook-ah!”

He paused at the door frame and turned around to see the beautiful mess which was Park Jimin one last time before officially departing.

Jungkook sent him a warm and reassuring smile, nodding in a silent agreement.

Without wasting a moment longer he disappeared into the deep woods with a few fallen leaves shortly after his trail.

“I like smart cars, do you like smart cars?” Someone appears next to him, bouncing happily on the balls of his feet. Jungkook glances warily at the stranger. He's on his way to calculus, and he's never seen this guy's shock of orange hair anywhere before.

He says, “Um.”

The stranger continues, gesturing wildly with his hands, “They're small and cute and efficient and they're so easy to park you have no idea.” He pauses to catch his breath. “And parking is a big issue when you have a '80s sedan like me. Like, ugh.” The stranger sighs and looks at Jungkook expectantly.

“Um,” he says again, “smart cars sound very convenient.” They stop walking outside a classroom, and the stranger beams a squarish smile that shows all his teeth.

“Right? This is my classroom,” the stranger gestures behind himself. “Are you taking calculus too? I'm Taehyung by the way.” Taehyung doesn't wait for an answer and just seizes Jungkook's hand to vigorously shake, before hopping into the classroom and seating himself loudly right in front of the professor. Jungkook follows him into the classroom and takes his usual seat in the middle. Not close enough to see the professor's nose hairs, but not far enough to get away with snoring like a lion. Not that Jungkook would even try to nap - classes are very important. But Jungkook has never seen this Taehyung guy in class before, nor anywhere else on campus. Huh.

Taehyung bugs the professor during the entire lesson.

“Prof! You have a calculation error in that last step!”
“Prof! You have a hair sticking up at two-thirds radians!”
“Prof! You forgot to dot that 'i'!”

Jungkook is surprised when the professor gives Taehyung a chupachup after the bell.

His surprise must show on his face, because the kid next to him laughs at him on his way out.

“Jungkook, right? The super freshman who's taking a load of sophomore classes?” This stranger has a distinct eye smile and a strange but friendly accent.

“Um, yeah,” Jungkook has no classes after this, so he can spare a few minutes. “I'm a freshman, but I wouldn't say super.”

“Don't be modest,” the stranger laughs and shakes Jungkook's offered hand. “I'm Jimin. Park Jimin. You must be wondering about Taehyung.”

Ah, yes. Taehyung. “He's odd. I'm new here, but he doesn't seem new? But I haven't seen him before.” Jungkook isn't very articulate.

“He was just released from the hospital yesterday,” Jimin clarifies. “I'm gonna catch a burger with him now, you wanna come?”

Jungkook is morbidly hungry, and sort of confused. Taehyung must have been in the hospital for ages if he missed over two months of classes. The professor finishes his conversation with a happy Taehyung, who then proceeds to skip to the door and drape himself over Jimin.

“I'm so hungry I could eat seventeen burgers!” He exclaims. “And nine sodas and twelve pizzas! Maybe.” Jungkook is following the pair of sophomores like a lost puppy for free food. Will it be free? Jungkook hopes so.

Taehyung continues, “Actually I lied, I don't think I can eat that much. But Prof Mark hasn't changed a bit, still so seriously boring.” He flaps his arms indignantly.

Jimin laughs as they take a seat in a window booth of the burger shack. “You're just too excited to be out of the hospital, man. How are your ribs?”

Jungkook glances between Taehyung and Jimin, and decides to sit next to Jimin. He's more normal.

“I was fine a long time ago! I don't know why they kept me there for so long,” Taehyung complains with a pout. They order several burgers and a milkshake each.

Jimin chuckles and sits back with his hands behind his head. “Well you already finished all your work for the semester, right? You don't even need to come to class.”

“I don't, but I came because I know you guys miss me,” Taehyung flutters his eyelashes at Jimin and begins stuffing his first burger into his face. “Also, the Professors must have been so depressed with you poor excuses for attentive students.”

Jimin shoves a burger in Jungkook's direction before picking up one for himself. “Taehyungie got himself squashed under a tree when we went snowboarding awhile ago.” He says between chews. “It was both the most amazing and scariest thing I have ever seen. He was giggling in the ambulance.”

Jungkook pauses mid-chew to stare at Taehyung in a new light. This guy was even weirder than he originally thought. “Um, this burger is pretty cool. I mean, you are pretty cool.”

They chat awhile about snowboarding and class and Jungkook. He answers their endless questions: “Yeah, I'm sure I'm a freshman. No, I've never been snowboarding before, but it sounds… Exhilarating. I'm a graphic design major. Yes, I do need to get home soon. Sorry.”

Jungkook doesn't have many friends. He goes to class, listens to the professor, then he goes home to do homework. He doesn't really have time for friends. But these two are intriguing. They dropped into his life like splashes of neon glow-in-the-dark paint on a white canvas. He can't tell if that's good or bad.

“You're later than usual, Jungkookie,” one of his roommates calls from the living room, where he's getting owned by the computer player at Wii tennis.

Jungkook drops his backpack on the dining table and pulls out two burgers he had packed for his roommates. “Hi, Yugyeom. I went to eat with… Some friends? Some people I met.” He doesn't really know. “So this is for you. I'm gonna go work on stuff.”

His roommate is delighted. “Friends!” The computer scores again as he squeals, distracted, “You should totally have them over sometime! And your poster is finished drying on the rack,” he adds.

Jungkook nods and makes his way to his room. As he's finishing up another project and two papers, he thinks about Taehyung and Jimin. Jimin is a traditional literature major. He spouts random quotes that Jungkook has trouble relating to the conversation. Jimin smiles like a cat and purrs like one too. His accent is almost adorable, but Jungkook isn't quite sure about using that word on a guy. Taehyung is a psychology major. His dream is to be a children's doctor. (“So he can be the kid he is under the guise of ""interacting” with them,“ Jimin had said, shaking his head at Taehyung building a fort out of the burger wrappers.) He likes spontaneity.

Despite the strangeness, Jungkook thinks he likes them."

this is awful it has literally not plot at all but trans jungkook holds a special place in my heart so i needed to do something. i apologize in advance

jungkook wasn’t sure of what had motivated him to do what he was about to do. one day he woke up feeling good about himself, and then the coming out thing appeared in his mind and suddenly he was sure that he was really going to tell someone, finally. he spent months dealing with self-hatred and insecurity, but now he was (almost) certain that he was going to be able to open up to someone. he never really considered coming out before, sure he had some passing thoughts, but the real thing? no way.

in that moment however, jungkook wasn’t so sure anymore. his hands were sweating and his heart was beating a thousand times per minute at least, a hundred different outcomes were going through his head, coming out was one of those situations where you can never be sure of what’s going to happen. yoongi could have a great reaction, there was a chance of him comforting jungkook and telling him it’s ok. but there was also the possibility of yoongi thinking jungkook is a freak, that he’s too young to know and is just confused.

jungkook decided to move forward with the “plan”, if he didn’t do it now, he probably would drag it out until it was too late.

while he walked to yoongi’s house (where jimin and hoseok already were, thanks to some random school project), jungkook started to feel more and more anxious and insecure. that was his first time coming out to someone, he had exactly 0 experience in the field and literally no idea of what the consequences might be like.

jungkook chose to tell yoongi first because he was the only one in their group (up until that moment) who wasn’t straight, he’s well aware that their situations are very different, but since the day yoongi told them jungkook began to feel more comfortable around his friend.

it was a normal day, they were all hanging out together at recess and suddenly yoongi was standing in front of them, rubbing his neck nervously. while looking at his feet he said “so… i’m bisexual? i mean, yeah. i am.”

it was a cute scene in jungkook’s opinion, everyone was smiling and cheering and taehyung got up and hugged yoongi hard, who was having a difficult time trying to look like he wasn’t about to cry. jungkook felt a lot happier in that moment. he knew that he could count on his friends, he hoped that maybe they would react as good to his news as they did with yoongi's.

jungkook rings the doorbell, trying with all his being not to run away and give up. fuck why did he even think this would be a good idea? he was clearly wrong.

hoseok opens the door, energetic as always, “hey kookie! i didn’t know you were coming too.” jungkook goes in, feeling a bit out of place, obviously he shouldn’t be there.

“uhm, i really just came to talk to yoongi for a bit?” after his name is mentioned yoongi comes out of the kitchen, going to greet his friend.

“spill.” his tone is casual. jungkook feels like he can’t breath. suddenly he is 15x times more aware of his breasts and how they weight on his chest. he remembers how he isn’t tall and broad and his voice isn’t deep and fuck. he’s never gonna look like a boy, he's always going to be awkward and just the thought of it made him feel sick.

“is it ok if we talk privately? i really don’t want to bother any of you but it’s kind of important.” yoongi looks a bit suspicious, but he still says “sure” and takes jungkook to his room.

jungkook sits on his bed, while yoongi is standing next to the window, almost sitting on a tiny table he had, looking at him with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. jungkook breathes deeply and thinks it’s now or never.

“i’m a boy. i know it doesn’t look like it but i am, you need to believe it, yoongi. i’m a boy and my body is all wrong and-” but he’s interrupted by yoongi hugging him tight. he’s stroking his hair lightly and humming. of all the stuff jungkook had imagined this definitely wasn’t one of them. yoongi really disliked physical contact, and yet here he was, hugging jungkook like it was the most important thing he had ever done.

“it’s ok, jungkook, you don’t need to prove anything to me. i trust you.” his voice is soft as he ends the hug, but still holds jungkook close.

“it’s so hard… yoongi, i shouldn’t feel like this, i shouldn’t be trans but i am and it’s so fucking hard.” jungkook feels tears coming and he tries his best to hold them back but he can’t, because yoongi is tracing circles on jungkook’s lower back with his hand and he’s finally getting rid of some of the weight that was always bringing him down, making him feel bad about himself all the time.

“jungkook, this doesn’t change anything, and you know that right? we’ll always love you and if you need help we will always be there for you.” jungkook rests his head on yoongi’s chest, trying to calm himself down. he lets a small “yeah i do” out.

“listen, do you need me to do something? do you want me to use new pronouns from now on? if you want i can lend you some clothes? or take you to get a haircut?” jungkook smiles so hard his cheeks start hurting. he never imagined he would feel content in a moment like this. yoongi is looking at him expectantly and he's smiling too. jungkook thinks yoongi has a lovely smile.

“thank you yoongi, for everything.” jungkook feels like he’s dreaming, this is too good to be true, he's not even sure he deserves this kind of reaction. he’s aware it’s not always gonna be like this, that people will be hateful toward him, and they will harass him verbally and physically. but in that moment he had just gotten the support of one of his best friends and that’s all that matters.

“i think that for now the clothes and pronouns are good.” he smiles at yoongi, who ruffles his hair playfully.

“sure thing.”

Jeongguk was young. Too young to love, as everyone never forgot to remind him. Jeongguk was young but there he was. In love with his best friend.

Taehyung appeared in his life when Jeongguk was fourteen, too young to accept the harsh reality of life, too old to get lost in his dreams. Taehyung came like a rainstorm in Jeongguk’s always too sunny life. And Jeongguk was always one to love the rain. Taehyung moved right next door with his parents on one rainy day. He appeared with rice cakes and the most unique smile Jeongguk ever saw in his life, it kind of reminded him of a peanut. After a few months with the sun that went by the name of Taehyung, Jeongguk realized he was in love. So crazily and stupidly in love with his friend.

Taehyung was a really friendly and bright boy. He smiled almost all the time and if he wasn’t it was only because he was busy chasing butterflies or making funny faces at his friends. Jeongguk was thankful for Taehyung friendship, he needed it. All kids making fun of him for being ‘too smart’, ‘too capable’. Jeongguk was in desperate need of a friend, of course there was always Jimin to tell him others were just too blind to see what a wonderful kid Jeongguk was. Kid, he hated that word. It made him feel so small and not important. Even when he said to people he hated being called a kid he only reserved a pat on the shoulder or ruffle of his hair. Jeongguk always wanted to glow up quickly, to get rid of the title ‘kid’. To get rid of that look in people’s eyes that told him they never really took him serious. But Taehyung never had that look in his eyes and Jeongguk was truly thankful for that. Taehyung was the only person who made Jeongguk feel as a normal person, not as a child that doesn’t understand life. Taehyung was the only one that Jeongguk could have normal conversations with, if you conceder space and ‘what if we could control time’ conversations normal that is. Taehyung was always taking in Jeongguk’s words seriously even when the young boy once screamed ‘go eat shit’ annoyed at losing an argument about who will win in a fight between cat woman and wonder woman, Taehyung’s only question after those words was ‘dog’s shit or my shit?’, which had them both cracking up with laughter, tears in their eyes and in one of those happy moments Jeongguk found himself leaning closer to the gaping for air Taehyung kissing him softly, scared and nervous from what reaction might come. But he only felt Taehyung’s lips stretch into a smile and felt two hands pulling him by the hoodie, limbs tangled as they fall on the cold floor. They laughed for good five minutes, eyes sparkling, lips falling all over each other’s faces, never really making effort of getting up from each other.

After that ‘accident’ their sleepovers became way more fun and Jeongguk wondered why they haven’t thought of that earlier. Hands tightly held, no longer embarrassed or nervous heads on shoulders and lots, lots of cuddling and small kisses everywhere they reached. Taehyung became even clingier than before, hugging Jeongguk close as soon as they were alone, even if that meant when their friends turned around to Taehyung’s pointing finger in the distance screaming ‘Look there!’ The night walks in the park became more special to both of them, being able to hold hands hidden by the dark of the night. They often went to just lay down and watch the stars, Taehyung making up stories of worlds far away from them, worlds that don’t exist for anyone but them.

Thanks to Taehyung Jeongguk learned how to ignore more easily all the people judging him, laughing at him. Because no one but Taehyung mattered, no one but Taehyung meant anything at all. Jeongguk was so lost in this love that he forgot the possibility of their parents catching them. Forgets until it happens.

One lazy summer afternoon when both of them are too lazy to move even an inch, praying some wind will appear, a summer storm, anything but the suffocating heath. Taehyung rolls over, half of his body on Jeongguk and gets a low groan from the boy but they both knew Jeongguk didn’t mind a bit. Even with their skin disgustingly sticky from sweat, they never forgot the small touches, the small shows of affection that resulted them both giggling and looking in eyes too deep, eyes too beautiful and calling. They kiss slowly letting every second of it sink deep inside their hearts, because they both believed that wasn’t just a simple crush. They were both sure with how they felt for the other and that no matter what adults say, they weren’t too young to fall in love. Their moment is broken by a gasp coming from the forgotten unlocked door, now gaping open with Jeongguk’s mother standing there, eyes wide and hands covering her mouth. Jeongguk wants to laugh. He wants to laugh at the way she acts all so carrying and affected by what she just saw, like she actually cared about what her son was doing or liking. With a shaking voice the woman orders Taehyung to leave, getting a laugh from her son and both of the boys storming out of the small apartment hand in hand. Jeongguk will forever refuse to tell Taehyung the reason his tears fell down his cheeks like waterfalls that night, why his heart was tearing apart even more.

In the end the second Jeongguk was old enough to do things on his own, legally of course because he has always forced to deal with the harsh life alone, they left everything and everyone behind. Sometimes Jeongguk felt bad for Taehyung because the boy had a wonderful family that loved him no matter what, family that smiled at the news he and Jeongguk were in a relationship. And yet Taehyung had to leave them behind. Jeongguk apologized so many times that in the end Taehyung threatened him that if he hears the words ‘I’m sorry’ leave Jeongguk’s mouth even one more time, he will get a hard slap on the ass. And maybe, just maybe the second Taehyung said that one slow and teasing ‘I’m sorry’ left the younger boy’s lips, grin on his face and that glint in his eyes that drove Taehyung crazy, taking him to all the wonderlands that lived inside both of them."

Yoongi is not sure what to say when the words are so sacred. He’s not sure what to say to himself, to the people. He’s not sure where he and Namjoon are going either. Seeing the dark sky and the blurred moon through the black clouds somehow makes him feel calm. But everything feels like a huge pile of dirty thoughts that aren’t meant to be brought out to the public. No one needs to know anything. Nobody needs to know about the sleepless nights working, trying to make something out of their lives. The lonely streets they’re walking through are silent. Only the different voices in his head are talking loudly. Talking about the possible endings of the path he chose years ago.

He doesn’t want to change the path. He can’t change anything. He only wants his hands not to feel numb again. The pressed nerves of his arms create a tingling sensation in his hands. It’s been lying in the same position for too long. The chair in his small studio knows his hands all too well.

His throat feels crushed. It’s not like he cares much. He doesn’t want his voice to be the same and he doesn’t want his lungs to breathe the same air anymore. He wants to breathe the air of a different place in a different time. Of a different reality. Where he can hide from the threatening responsibilities.

His cold feet can’t feel the grey asphalt under him. He only feels the rapid beat of his heart that won’t calm down. His heart is beating for silence. It’s beating for the prohibited calmness in his life. He’s been listening to his heavy feet hitting the ground in a rhythmic manner for the past hour. He’s been listening to the quiet breathing of his band mate for five years.

He wants to break the cycle of his messy thoughts. It always comes back to the same thing - the theater he plays in. He feels like a human puppet that was made to walk a road of sweat and tears. A road where only the hard work matters. No one really looks for emotion. It’s the physical, materialistic things that count.

After walking in silence for an hour he mutters, “What are we playing?” he can only cringe at his words. Things like that aren’t supposed to be said out loud. But he can’t stop himself from answering to his own question, “I guess we’re playing real people. Right?”

The question doesn’t matter. Both of them know that. It’s a statement in every perspective there is. It comes from the white pure corners of his heart that keeps his mind clean from his madness. Now those corners are dyed in a light grey colour. It's been about four months since he first started questioning everything. Is he doing the right thing? Is the playing in the right theater play? The heart has been grey since then. It’s not the madness that’s colouring his insides. It’s his own mind questioning his path and his reality and not finding the answer that would satisfy his needs.

“I mean, I’m happy but I’m not sure if what we present is real anymore. It’s like playing a real person. Not living, you know. Playing.”

Namjoon only shrugged like he didn’t want that train of thought to come into his mind. He’s been bothering his own mind with questions like what is he doing and why for too long. He’s tired of his own mind. So he only answers, “It depends.”

“On what?” Yoongi felt like screaming his lungs out but his serious voice only got louder on every word, “On the hours I spend in the practice room? On the hours and hours I spend trying to keep my eyes open? Is that what it is?”

Namjoon doesn’t reply. He feels the same way too. None of them are sure of anything anymore. Sometimes it feels like an amazing dream with heavenly gardens but when the dark comes he has to look at the mirror only to see his red and swollen eyes. At that moment it doesn’t feel like a dream. Namjoon wants to rest. It’s not like he hates the job but sometimes it feels like there’s too much to do and too little effort he puts in everything. Time doesn’t matter. There’s not too little time. There’s too little effort he puts into everything. Or at least that’s how everyone sees it. A week feels like 7 hours from a toddler’s life, where everything is glued into nothingness that you won’t remember later. Sometimes Namjoon can’t even remember what month it is. He wants to be a kid again and to have that childish carelessness. To have the comfort of being able to make mistakes that people will accept as learning. Children learn to survive by making mistakes.

Namjoon can’t make mistakes. None of them can.

Yoongi feels the numbness leaving his arms and only the anger is left boiling in his veins. He wanted this. He still wants it so much. But the play of this real life theater is becoming a tragedy where every character either dies a hero or lives a peculiar life that doesn’t include any of the heroes left in their mind.

He always wanted to make an impact on people. That’s one of the reasons why he took a role in the play. It felt much more like a role in the beginning. When you have to figure out what to say and how to use your body language. It was interesting. Now it feels normal. Did he get used to it? Or did he become the character he always thought he will never let himself be?

Namjoon only puffs the cold January air through his nose, then spins around on his heel and asks if Yoongi wants to go back. By now they’ve been wandering the streets for about an hour or two. They left at midnight. For a “morning” walk. Yoongi smirks lightly at this thought. When you’re living a life like this, the sun and the moon changes places. A lot of things change. Some of the bad things change places with the good. But at least in the past the bad things were real. Now it feels like every bad thing has been written by a scriptwriter.

Yoongi nods barely visibly at Namjoon and turns around. He stops to puff the air from his lungs and to watch it float in the cold night weather. To watch it travel through the atmosphere. He wants to feel as light as that little smoke. Yoongi coughs heavily into his fist and starts walking.

“Be careful with the cold air. Don’t want to get sick. Got a lot to do.”

Yoongi smirks at Namjoon’s words and only says, “Unfortunately.”

wtf is this idk

It was hard enough filling out an application, and even more so when Jimin couldn't find a proper writing utensil for the job at stake. He'd searched through his book bag and all around the damn apartment for a stupid black pen, one that would have enough ink to fill out the worksheet and hopefully land him a new job. In all honesty, he'd never done this before, even though he was almost twenty and in college, while living with his boyfriend. As a young teen he got it easy by working at his father's coffee shop and he hadn't needed to fill out any type of job application.

But after his father fell ill and had to close down the shop, he was in desperate need of a job because his beloved boyfriend was struggling to pay the bills by himself.

Someone in their right mind would think that a hardworking college student has hundreds of pens and pencils laying mindlessly around, and yet there was nothing of the sort. For a moment Jimin thought about sneaking into Yoongi's studio just down the road and stealing one of his pens from the giant cup he always had placed on his desk. Or possibly he could go to the store and buy an entire pack of black ballpoints and save the other ones for school!

Well, he would have done just that, but Yoongi kept his studio doors locked and was the only person to own a key and Jimin didn't have a single dollar to his name so buying them was out of the equation.

Jimin sighed and slumped down on the sofa with his sorry little application in hand, knocking his head back against the cushions with a loud groan. Yoongi would be home from classes in one hour, and because he was always responsible and owned the things he needed, there wasn't a doubt that he had some pens.

But Jimin was a very impatient man, mind you, and with another moan of annoyance he pushed himself off the couch and went rummaging through the apartment for something, anything to complete this damn job application.

Much to his dismay, he found two pens, both of which were glittery gel pens with vibrant, sparkling ink. One green and the other purple.

“It could work,” Jimin mumbled to himself as he slipped into the chair by the table. He popped the cap of the purple one and printed his name on the dotted line, hardly being bothered by the vibrant, shiny color. He continued filling out the information (what happened to applying online?), losing track of time because who knew a job application was so hard to complete?

It wasn't until he heard the door unlock and open that he lifted his head and craned his neck to look past the kitchen wall and into the living room, where Yoongi was leaning forward to pick up their cat Mitsy to greet her.

“How was class?” Jimin asked, looking back at his rather vibrant piece of paper in front of him. Maybe the manager of this job would think he was artistic.

Yoongi sighed and set the animal down, taking an extra moment to shed his jacket and school bag before moving to the kitchen for a glass of milk. “Boring as hell. How is your job application going?”

Jimin thought it was going great; he filled out the needed information, completed most of the questions and even kept a steady pace of nice penmanship for the most part. If he didn't get this job, he'd be surprised, really. “Everything is good, hyung,” he assured with a smile, watching as Yoongi rounded the corner and met him halfway for a light kiss.

“Let me see,” he ordered with a soft smile as he pulled himself back, fingers already catching the slip of paper before Jimin could stop him. One glance was all it took before the elder was a laughing mess against the kitchen floor, clutching at his stomach as the fit of giggles escaped his lips. “What the fuck, Park Jimin? Filling out an application with a sparkly purple pen? What were you thinking?”

It was almost hard to understand him, because the guy was laughing so hard. Jimin crossed his arms over his chest and frowned; what was so wrong with that? “What? I couldn't find anything else!” he cried defensively, lip jutting out in a hard pout.

Yoongi tried his hardest to quiet the loud, cackling laughter as he pushed himself off the floor and into the chair next to the confused looking boy. “Baby, why didn't you wait until I got home? I would have given you a lifetime supply of black ink pens.”

Jimin was embarrassed then, his cheeks aflame and tinged pink as he looked down at his folded hands placed against his lap. “I was impatient,” he mumbled, not daring to look Yoongi in the eye in fear of being made fun of. “Besides, what's so wrong with a purple pen?”

Yoongi was howling again, one of his hands clamped over his mouth to hush him up as he leaned forward to pull Jimin against him. “Jimin,” he cooed, his chest constricting with each bout of giggles that escaped his lungs.

Jimin huffed softly and pulled away, still pouting because what the hell was so wrong with a purple pen? Sure, it sparkled, but so what? He bet many people used gel pens to complete important applications! Why else would they have been made? “Whatever,” Jimin grunted, snatching his vibrant paper before Yoongi could tease him further. “I'll finish it and turn it in tomorrow morning.”

~*~

Jimin did, in fact, turn in his application the next morning and was told by a skeptical looking woman that he'd get a call in the next few days to decide if he'd gotten the job or not.

He went about his life as usual; morning classes and evenings spent cuddling Yoongi and the cat. He even prepared a lovely pizza dinner for the both of them on Friday, because he felt like surprising Yoongi after his hard day at work.

Yoongi had presented Jimin with another job application at the same office place he worked at a week later, not even forgetting to pass him a black ink pen with a soft smile. “Here. I'm sure you'll get hired this time.”

Jimin felt disheartened but began filling it out anyway, with Yoongi sitting beside him to give extra help.

His cellphone rang once, than twice with an unknown number flashing against the screen. For a moment he thought about forgetting it and continuing the paperwork, but something in his chest pulled him to reach for the device and answer it.

“Hello?”

Yoongi watched as the younger boy listened to the voice on the other end of the line, eyes wide and lips parted as he suddenly spewed out many 'thank you's.

When he hung up, there was a smug look on his face. “I got the job,” he stated proudly."

Merry Christmas!!!

Yoongi woke up to the sound of excited feet running down the hall towards his room. He blinked open his eyes just before his door burst open, his seemingly overjoyed boyfriend running in decked out in a baggy holiday sweater. The grayscale snowmen stitched onto the fabric looked like they were bouncing with every single ragged breath Jungkook took as he ran up, jumping into the bed next to Yoongi.

“Merry Christmas!” Jungkook yelled, wrapping his arms around Yoongi’s waist just a little too tight. Yoongi laughed lightly, running a tired hand through the boy’s hair.

“Is it breakfast time?” Yoongi asked, his voice still hoarse from sleep and a yawn still fighting it’s way through his body. Jungkook bit his lip, looking up at his boyfriend sheepishly.

“Well… I mean you’ve been really busy. And you haven’t been sleeping enough… so I thought I should let you sleep. But then it started snowing and I didn’t feel like waiting any longer.” Yoongi smiled sweetly, pressing a tentative kiss to Jungkook’s forehead. Even then, two years into their relationship, any form of kissing made both of them nervous. But this was a special exception.

“What time is it baby?” He asked groggily, rubbing the sleep from his eyes a little awkwardly. Jungkook laughed, a feeling that reverberated warmly through Yoongi’s chest.

“It’s only two, you’re fine. I did make breakfast though! Or, I’m in the middle of making breakfast. Come down when you’re ready, okay?” Jungkook gave Yoongi a big squeeze before detangling himself from the older boy and bounding back out the door. Yoongi couldn’t help but smile. He could hear his boyfriend downstairs in the kitchen singing loudly to some Christmas song. It was the first day Yoongi had off in at least a month. Christmas Day actually. And Jungkook had been so sweet and supportive through the last busy month but, Yoongi knew it made him sad. They’d been together for two years but it still felt like when they had first started dating. Every day apart was somehow an eternity.

But today was going to be special. Yoongi pulled himself up out of his bed, not even bothering to put on a shirt as he padded through the room towards his work bag. He knew that the one place he could ever get away with hiding something from Jungkook would be there, and after a minute of rustling he finds it. Yoongi takes a deep breath, trying to steady himself before he follows the sound of his boyfriend’s voice down the stairs to the kitchen.

He stops just inside the door frame, taking a moment to drink in his boyfriend. Jungkook is beautiful. Everyone always said that once you could see colors everything would change, and everything somehow became even more beautiful. But Yoongi called bullshit. No amount of color could make the raven haired boy more beautiful. Jungkook’s hair was so dark in comparison to the rest of his features, except for his eyes. They were always dark but, still smiling. Always smiling.

Yoongi coughed a little, making Jungkook turn around and give him that smile. That stupid little bunny smile that always made Yoongi’s heart feel like a Christmas tree.

“Kookie um… I want to try something.” He mumbled out, pulling the little sprig of mistletoe out from behind his back and holding it above his head. He felt stupid, but this was easier than asking out loud. “Merry Christmas.” He said, but it sounded more like a scared question.

There was a moment of silence. Jungkook looked at him, eyes wide and mouth hanging open just a little bit. Yoongi silently cursed himself for ever even suggesting it. They’d started dating and fallen in love fast… so fast that when it finally occurred to them that they might not even be soul mates it was already too late. They were already in too deep, and neither one of them wanted the answer to be no. So they just hadn’t kissed. Not really at least.

Jungkook cocked his head to the side, stepping closer to Yoongi who was biting his lip nervously. Jungkook looked down at him, shyly at first, before reaching out to cup Yoongi’s cheek in his hand.

“This doesn’t change anything. Okay? I love you. I want to be with you. Only you.” Jungkook said, his voice shaking almost imperceptibly, but Yoongi noticed. Yoongi always noticed.

“I don’t care if you’re not my soulmate. Okay? I promise. I love you so much Kookie.” Yoongi mumbled, not even looking up at the boy out of shyness. Instead he opted for wrapping his arms around the younger boy’s waist. He could feel it more than hear it when Jungkook took a deep breath, tilting Yoongi’s chin up so he was facing the younger boy.

“Are you ready?” Jungkook whispered, nervous excitement dancing behind his eyes. Yoongi only nodded, trying to calm his now racing heart.

It wasn’t what he expected. It was better than anything he thought it would be. Jungkook’s lips pressed against his and he couldn’t help but smile because it felt so right. So complete. If nature was a person he had found that person. It was Jungkook. A chaotic hurricane of emotion, a beautiful sun-kissed day, the electricity in the air just before a thunderstorm, he’d found it. He’d found it all and more wrapped up in this beautiful human being before him. And now that person was kissing him.

He pulled away slowly, a little bit scared of opening his eyes. He blinked them open slowly, letting out a quiet gasp as he did. Before him stood the most beautiful man he’d ever seen in his life. His hair wasn’t black at all, it was this beautiful deep color that looked like cherries smelled and that lit up even under the pathetic fluorescent lighting of their shitty kitchen. His cheeks were tinted with the color he could only imagine a rose would be, getting darker under Yoongi’s stare.

“Hyung?” Jungkook asked tentatively after a moment, biting into his lip with a smile. God those lips looked the way sunshine felt. “Are you crying?”

Yoongi laughed, shaking his head vehemently as he wiped at his eyes, not wanting to look away from Jungkook for even a second.

“I’m fine. I’m fine. Just, kiss me again?” He asked sheepishly, still unwilling to tear his gaze away from his beautiful boyfriend. Jungkook laughed, pulling the older boy back into his arms.

“Anything for you. Soulmate.”

Merry Christmas."

The tour guide has dyed pink hair and a warm smile. He also doesn’t know anything about the history of art.

There are only a few things that annoy Namjoon, and this has to be in the top three. He is exhausted from a class that ran overtime and his arms are full of a last-minute assignment that his professor forgot to announce when it was supposed to be. He wanted to look at some art. Maybe single out the painting he has been thinking to do his assignment on. Instead, he is stuck between a group of strangers who are only there for some sort of outing and a lousy guide who probably forgot to read his job description.

“That isn’t how you pronounce Gauguin.”

The guide pauses. Even Namjoon does a double take.

“Excuse me?” the guide says. Jihoon, reads the name tag.

The guy has mint hair, a tattoo behind his ear, and he is wearing the same university hoodie as Namjoon. “That isn’t how you pronounce Gauguin,” he repeats, slowly. His voice sounds deeper now, somehow. “And earlier you fumbled on the name of the painter of Lady With Veena. It’s M. F. Husain. Maqbool Fida Husain. I can correct you at a few more places if you want, but I suppose it isn’t my job.”

“I —” the guide turns red. “Right. Sorry. I’m sorry.”

Namjoon hides his smile behind his hand and doesn’t look away from the Mint Hair guy. Even when the guide turns around with red ears and probably a bruised ego.

He doesn’t even realise he is staring until the Mint Hair Guy meets his eyes and smiles awkwardly. His smile is familiar, and Namjoon recognises it from a few classes they share. It’s like a lightbulb going off. “I like your hoodie,” he offers. He doesn’t, not really. The colour is an ugly green that clashes horribly with the uglier lime yellow font and even more horribly with the guy’s mint hair. But the guy somehow pulls it off. Unfair. Beautiful. “We have a few classes together, I think.”

“Min Yoongi,” the guy introduces. And then, “Hey, I remember you.”

Namjoon finds himself more than a little surprised. “You do?”

Yoongi shrugs. Maybe even blushes a little. “I got into a fight with you on the first day of class, remember? About colour theory? I was the one who argued that it’s useless because there are so many exceptions. I mean, what’s the fucking point, am I right?”

A mother looks over disapprovingly. Neither of them pay any attention.

Namjoon spits, “You!” dramatically. He smiles when Yoongi laughs, and feels his heart flutter in his chest a little. Only a little.

The thing is, the simple fact of the matter is: Namjoon remembers him too, but not from that first day. It’s a fuzzy memory, like a polaroid lost to time. He remembers him from later. He remembers him from this: it was a couple weeks after the fight, and Yoongi had walked in late with a cup of coffee in his hands and his head ducked low, and Namjoon had thought about him then. It had been brief but it had made him pause, for a moment. Had made him take another glance.

Now, Namjoon can’t look away.

They loiter at the end of the group. A seven year old kid is eyeing Yoongi’s tattoo with interest, and the guide, Jihoon, is steadfastly avoiding them and their gaze. Yoongi listens to Namjoon talk with the ghost of a smile on his face, and when he tells him that his friends and family have dubbed him the ‘art nerd’ he snorts and tugs resolutely at his sleeve.

“Prove it,” he teases. “Imitationalism. Yes or no?”

“Yes?” Namjoon says, caught off guard. “I mean — yeah. Yes. Every form of art is a yes.”

Yoongi hums. “Interesting.”

“Personally,” adds Namjoon. “It isn’t for me, really. But there are artists who have mastered it, and it’s always interesting to see how different painters still paint different pictures — even if they are looking at the same thing.”

“It’s a little discouraging to judge art by how real it looks though, no?”

“What even measures art?” Namjoon wonders. “What determines whether it’s good or bad? Popularity? Objectivity? Personal taste? None of them really make any sense though, do they? Everyone sees art differently. And they treat it differently too. A good painting is when it’s genuine. Not if it looks real enough, or if the paint used is good enough, or if it’s colourful enough.”

“Hm. One last question. The last one, I promise.” Yoongi nudges his shoulder with his. His tongue is caught between his teeth, and Namjoon stares a little too long at his mouth. “Do you know what a veena is?”

Namjoon grins. “Veena is a string instrument from the Indian subcontinent. It has been played for thousands of years. It’s exact origin — I’m not sure of it, but I read all about it when I saw that painting by M. F. Husain. I ended up falling into a wikipedia binge about traditional instruments, their workings and their origins of many, many countries. I didn’t get any sleep that night.”

Yoongi is grinning too. “I think, Kim Namjoon, that I will love to get to know you more.”

I hope so, Namjoon almost says. There is something so honest about you. I hope I will get to talk to you again. I hope you won’t end up forgetting about me when you walk out. I hope you remember me. I hope I’m worth remembering. I hope I hope I hope.

(Almost.)

The story goes something like this: Namjoon first sees Yoongi in Professor Moon’s 7 a.m Life Drawing class. And he properly meets Yoongi in the middle of summer, in one of the art museums he loves to frequent. Yoongi’s wearing the same university hoodie as him, and he has a smile that Namjoon recognises from some of the classes they share. They talk, because of course they do. Yoongi is older, and cute, and he doesn’t meet his eyes when he tells him to call him hyung. Namjoon learns a lot of things that evening: about the Renaissance and its impact on art, about Professor Moon and his ex fiance, about the significance of cave arts from millions of years ago, about the soft syllables of the Daegu dialect. About the shadow of Yoongi’s smile.

Namjoon goes home that evening with a number scrawled on a piece of paper and a promise of a text. Taehyung is asleep. Hoseok is humming a song in the kitchen and he listens, and laughs, and nods his head at all the right times. Namjoon is warm.

(In bed, that night, he wonders if Yoongi learned anything that day as well. If he remembered something. Anything. Him.)

(Yoongi did — about poetry, and Ilsan, and the smile of a dimple, and his favourite park, and a puppy named Rapmon, and the SoundCloud rapper RM, and Kim Namjoon too. He did learn. And he did remember. But Namjoon doesn’t know this now. He won’t know this now. But someday. Soon.)"

The seven members of BTS had a couple of days off and management decided to book all seven members an appointment at a massage clinic. All of the members were excited about the prospect of having all of the kinks worked out of their overworked muscles. There were only three massage therapists scheduled for the day, so four of the members would have to occupy their time while the other three for their massages first.

The first three to get their massages was the maknae line. Each one was brought to their rooms and walked through how a full body massage works. Taehyung got himself situated quickly, very much ready for the ensuing relaxation.

The beginning of the massage was really nice. Feeling the kinks worked out of his back felt heavenly. It seemed that management had sprung for all the stops. Taehyung was getting a full body deep tissue massage. Instead of just going for a standard massage, they were also getting hot rocks placed on their bodies. It felt incredibly nice. With the dim lighting, calming music, and the loosening of his muscles Taehyung was almost sure he could have fallen asleep.

He was so close to falling asleep that he didn’t notice the sensation immediately. Like a hypnogogic jerk, one minute he was on his way to dreamland, the next minute he was startled awake with hitching breath. The massage therapist didn’t even have time to ask if they should adjust how much pressure they were applying, when the calm and peaceful silence was interrupted.

“HEYEEESHHHH. Sorry about that.” Taehyung sniffled, slightly embarrassed. The massage continued and Taehyung brushed off the sneeze as a one off. Taehyung closed his eyes and hoped that the sneeze wouldn’t ruin his body’s attempt at drifting off.

Sadly, it seemed that fate had other plans. Not even five minutes later, Taehyung could feel his nose become increasingly itchy. Seeing as he was currently face down on the massage table, there wasn’t a whole lot he could do to quell the itch. All he could really do with altering his position was scrunch his nose up a bunch and hope that it would work.

That method bought him like two seconds. His breath didn’t even hitch before he sneezed again. “HEHESHHH, HIHSHHHEEHHHH.” Taehyung sniffled and the massage therapist offered him a tissue. He gladly took it and blew his nose. He wasn’t entirely sure why he was so sneezy, but he was embarrassed about the loudness of his sneezes. Normally it’s not too bad, but there had been signs in the lobby asking patrons to be quiet so as not to disturb the other patrons.

He did his best to get himself re situated, but the itchiness in his sinuses hadn’t gone away. It only lessened a little bit. Taehyung somehow managed to get through the rest of the back massage without sneezing anymore. Although, his nose was getting increasingly itchy without fully forming any sneezes.

He rolled onto his back and the therapist continued the massage. The therapist began with his neck and face. That was when it hit Taehyung. He hadn’t been able to smell it before, but with the therapist’s hands coming almost right next to his nose, he could smell the distinct scent of something floral.

Upon catching a whiff of the subtle scent, Taehyung could feel his breath begin to hitch. He quickly swatted the therapist’s hands away as he maneuvered himself into a sitting position. He hastily brought his hand up to his nose and waited for the impending explosion.

“HEHISHHH, HIH-STIESHHH, HEH-STSCHHH.” He sniffled but knew that he wasn’t remotely finished. He quickly turned to the therapist and bowed. “Sorry, but I’m going to need to end the se-session e-early.” He sneezed again into his hand, looking very sheepish. The therapist nodded and left the room.

Putting his clothes back on was a slow process. False starts interrupting him every few seconds. Once he was fully dressed, he grabbed a couple of tissues from the box and blew his nose. It marginally helped. He stuffed some more tissues in his pocket, then went back out to the lobby.

Taehyung was met with sympathetic looks from his four hyungs as he sat down in one of the chairs. Yoongi approached, placing his hand on the younger’s forehead. “Hyung, I'm not sick. The therapist was using lavender oil and it se-set me off.” He quickly turned away from Yoongi and pitched forward with another loud sneeze. Taehyung then stood up. “I’m going to go outside so I don’t disturb the other patrons.”

Before he could actually leave, Seokjin spoke up. “You do realize that we’re the only ones here right?” Taehyung shook his head, having forgotten that the company had made sure the massage parlor would be empty. “I hardly doubt that Jungkook and Jimin are too terribly bothered by your sneezing.” Hoseok chimed in next. “In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if one or both of them are laughing a little.” Taehyung sighed as he sat back down, feeling a bit better that he probably wasn’t ruining anybody else’s relaxation.

Over the next half hour, Taehyung was pretty sniffly. The therapist he’d had, called up Namjoon for his massage and another therapist arrived to get ready for their shift. Once the half hour was over, Jimin and Jungkook came out of the rooms they had been in, looking completely relaxed. The three remaining members were called into their appointments.

As the other two maknaes sat down, Taehyung once again felt the tickle that had been plaguing him for the past hour and a half resurface. He brought his hand back up to his face and sneezed loudly four times. Afterwards, he pulled a couple of tissues out of his pocket and blew his nose.

“You good there hyung?” Jungkook asked. Taehyung nodded. “The massage therapist was using lavender oil. I’ll stop sneezing once we get back to the dorm and I can wash it off. The two nodded and chatted with Taehyung with intermittent teasing until their hyungs were done with their massages.

Once all of the massages were over, the group went home . They made sure that Taehyung got the first shower to minimize his suffering. Once all had showered, they all got settled in the living room and started a movie marathon, making sure to keep a box of tissues nearby for any residual sneezes that might come from the second youngest.

It was cold. Not chilly in the way that you’d want a light jacket. Cold as in the only place you wanted to be was wearing three coats under two blankets in front of a fireplace and even then you’d still be on the cold side. Granted this was one of the struggles of camping.

During the day it had been nice, you spent it walking the beautiful trails with your friends wearing a warm jacket as the sunlight graced you.

Now the sun had turned its back on you. As night fell so did the temperature, down, down, down till it was colder than you’d like to see. Much less when you would be sleeping in a tent.

The only thing keeping you alive at this point was your boyfriend Jungkook. All of you sat around the fire laughing and telling stories. You had sat shivering in your chair beside him when he without a word pulled you from your seat into his lap. He opened his puffy coat letting you in before wrapping it around you as much as he could.

There was no way you were going to protest. It seemed like no matter the circumstances Jungkook was warm. It didn’t matter if he was out of cold water he still had a warmth radiating from him. In this instance, it was the best thing you could think of. You had no shame around his band-mates. They already knew how the two of you were and didn’t bat an eye at any shenanigans. You didn’t hesitate to rest your head on his chest under the scarf he had wrapped loosely around his neck.

Jungkook adjusted his scarf to keep you warm too before his hand that wasn’t holding the jacket around you fell into a soothing rhythm rubbing your back.

Normally you would be an active part of the conversation with his band-mates and their significant others but tonight you settled for mumbled additions to the conversations into your boyfriend’s chest that he would relay to the rest of the group.

“You ready to go to sleep, baby?” Jungkook leaned forward brushing his lips against your ear. He had noticed you starting to doze off.

“We can stay up if you want to.” You said looking up at him with blurry eyes from how tired you were.

“I think everyone’s getting ready to head to bed soon.” He said.

“Mmm, okay then.” You mumbled into his chest. Jungkook nuzzled his face into the top of your head for a moment.

Before you knew it your boyfriend was standing up with you in his arms. The way he did it was so smooth as if you weighed nothing.

“We’re headed to bed for the night, see you guys in the morning.” He said before walking off in the direction of your tent as everyone said good night. You held onto him tight, your arms wrapped around his neck, face pressed into the place where his neck met his shoulder.

“I have to put you down to open the tent, babe.” He said against your neck. You hummed in acknowledgment before he set you softly on the ground outside your tent. He was quick to open the tent but before you could step in he picked you up again carrying you into the tent. You let out a small laugh of surprise.

Jungkook set you down on top of your sleeping bag.

“Here, let me.” He said as he pulled off your shoes. Moving to your luggage he pulled out bedclothes for both of you. He handed you yours before he changed into his. You’d be lying if you said you didn’t get distracted by him taking his shirt off while you tried to change.

After you were changed you climbed into your sleeping bag, which at the moment was just as cold as it was outside. You let out a whine of complaint. Jungkook climbed into his after changing.

For a few moments, you tossed and turned unable to warm up your sleeping bag. Shivers began to overtake you again. You hated this cold and you hated being so far away from your boyfriend. You reasoned that both of those problems could be dealt with at once.

Opening your sleeping bag you crawled out moving over to your boyfriend’s. He laid in his on his phone, glancing up he looked at you with a raised eyebrow. You didn’t elaborate as you opened his sleeping bag and crawled in. It was big enough that once you squeezed in it wasn’t uncomfortable. It was close quarters that was for sure but you weren’t going to complain.

“Still cold?” He asked adjusting so he could move his arms around you welcoming you into the sleeping bag with him without complaint.

“Mhm.” You hummed making yourself comfortable against him, resting your head on his chest like you had before.

“Come here,” He said pulling you in closer to him before pressing a kiss to the top of your head. You let out a content hum as you started to feel warm again. “Probably should have gotten a two-person sleeping bag.”

“Is that a thing?” You questioned looking up at him from his chest.

“Seems like it should be.” He shrugged.

“I don’t mind being this close.” You said.

“Me either.” He smiled at you, threading his hand through your hair. He leaned down pressing a kiss against your forehead. “You’re tired, get some sleep. I’ll be here.”

“Mmm, I guess.” You said. “I like talking to you though.”

“We can talk in the morning.” He said with a small laugh. No matter how long you had been together you always seemed to catch him off guard with how honest you were. He couldn’t help but blush at your admission of you liking talking to him. Of course, you did, you spent almost all of your time together but it felt special to hear it.

“I guess.” You said with a small smile. “I love you, and not just because you’re warm literally. I like how warm you are, in your heart.” You said tapping his chest for emphasis.

“Okay, you’re a bit too cute when you’re half asleep you need to go to bed before I can’t handle anymore.” He laughed and you joined him.

Wrapping your arms around him and nuzzling into his chest you closed your eyes.

“Good night,” You mumbled against him.

“Good night, I love you.” He said his hand rubbing your back. It didn’t take long for you to drift off to sleep and when you did Jungkook didn’t stop.

For a while, your boyfriend stayed up taking in the sight of you sound asleep on his chest. He silently cherished just how lucky he was to have you in his life.

The soft mumble of his band-mates and their loved ones talking around the campfire was in the background as he finally drifted to sleep."

Jeongguk was young. Too young to love, as everyone never forgot to remind him. Jeongguk was young but there he was. In love with his best friend.

Taehyung appeared in his life when Jeongguk was fourteen, too young to accept the harsh reality of life, too old to get lost in his dreams. Taehyung came like a rainstorm in Jeongguk’s always too sunny life. And Jeongguk was always one to love the rain. Taehyung moved right next door with his parents on one rainy day. He appeared with rice cakes and the most unique smile Jeongguk ever saw in his life, it kind of reminded him of a peanut. After a few months with the sun that went by the name of Taehyung, Jeongguk realized he was in love. So crazily and stupidly in love with his friend.

Taehyung was a really friendly and bright boy. He smiled almost all the time and if he wasn’t it was only because he was busy chasing butterflies or making funny faces at his friends. Jeongguk was thankful for Taehyung friendship, he needed it. All kids making fun of him for being ‘too smart’, ‘too capable’. Jeongguk was in desperate need of a friend, of course there was always Jimin to tell him others were just too blind to see what a wonderful kid Jeongguk was. Kid, he hated that word. It made him feel so small and not important. Even when he said to people he hated being called a kid he only reserved a pat on the shoulder or ruffle of his hair. Jeongguk always wanted to glow up quickly, to get rid of the title ‘kid’. To get rid of that look in people’s eyes that told him they never really took him serious. But Taehyung never had that look in his eyes and Jeongguk was truly thankful for that. Taehyung was the only person who made Jeongguk feel as a normal person, not as a child that doesn’t understand life. Taehyung was the only one that Jeongguk could have normal conversations with, if you conceder space and ‘what if we could control time’ conversations normal that is. Taehyung was always taking in Jeongguk’s words seriously even when the young boy once screamed ‘go eat shit’ annoyed at losing an argument about who will win in a fight between cat woman and wonder woman, Taehyung’s only question after those words was ‘dog’s shit or my shit?’, which had them both cracking up with laughter, tears in their eyes and in one of those happy moments Jeongguk found himself leaning closer to the gaping for air Taehyung kissing him softly, scared and nervous from what reaction might come. But he only felt Taehyung’s lips stretch into a smile and felt two hands pulling him by the hoodie, limbs tangled as they fall on the cold floor. They laughed for good five minutes, eyes sparkling, lips falling all over each other’s faces, never really making effort of getting up from each other.

After that ‘accident’ their sleepovers became way more fun and Jeongguk wondered why they haven’t thought of that earlier. Hands tightly held, no longer embarrassed or nervous heads on shoulders and lots, lots of cuddling and small kisses everywhere they reached. Taehyung became even clingier than before, hugging Jeongguk close as soon as they were alone, even if that meant when their friends turned around to Taehyung’s pointing finger in the distance screaming ‘Look there!’ The night walks in the park became more special to both of them, being able to hold hands hidden by the dark of the night. They often went to just lay down and watch the stars, Taehyung making up stories of worlds far away from them, worlds that don’t exist for anyone but them.

Thanks to Taehyung Jeongguk learned how to ignore more easily all the people judging him, laughing at him. Because no one but Taehyung mattered, no one but Taehyung meant anything at all. Jeongguk was so lost in this love that he forgot the possibility of their parents catching them. Forgets until it happens.

One lazy summer afternoon when both of them are too lazy to move even an inch, praying some wind will appear, a summer storm, anything but the suffocating heath. Taehyung rolls over, half of his body on Jeongguk and gets a low groan from the boy but they both knew Jeongguk didn’t mind a bit. Even with their skin disgustingly sticky from sweat, they never forgot the small touches, the small shows of affection that resulted them both giggling and looking in eyes too deep, eyes too beautiful and calling. They kiss slowly letting every second of it sink deep inside their hearts, because they both believed that wasn’t just a simple crush. They were both sure with how they felt for the other and that no matter what adults say, they weren’t too young to fall in love. Their moment is broken by a gasp coming from the forgotten unlocked door, now gaping open with Jeongguk’s mother standing there, eyes wide and hands covering her mouth. Jeongguk wants to laugh. He wants to laugh at the way she acts all so carrying and affected by what she just saw, like she actually cared about what her son was doing or liking. With a shaking voice the woman orders Taehyung to leave, getting a laugh from her son and both of the boys storming out of the small apartment hand in hand. Jeongguk will forever refuse to tell Taehyung the reason his tears fell down his cheeks like waterfalls that night, why his heart was tearing apart even more.

In the end the second Jeongguk was old enough to do things on his own, legally of course because he has always forced to deal with the harsh life alone, they left everything and everyone behind. Sometimes Jeongguk felt bad for Taehyung because the boy had a wonderful family that loved him no matter what, family that smiled at the news he and Jeongguk were in a relationship. And yet Taehyung had to leave them behind. Jeongguk apologized so many times that in the end Taehyung threatened him that if he hears the words ‘I’m sorry’ leave Jeongguk’s mouth even one more time, he will get a hard slap on the ass. And maybe, just maybe the second Taehyung said that one slow and teasing ‘I’m sorry’ left the younger boy’s lips, grin on his face and that glint in his eyes that drove Taehyung crazy, taking him to all the wonderlands that lived inside both of them."

Jungkook was mad, no, he was furious. He paced around the stage, tapping his watch impatiently. It had been seventeen minutes since practice started and Taehyung, a.k.a. the second lead, still wasn't here. He had tried calling him four times, sent him five texts (in a row! If he wasn't so panicked Jungkook would've been mortified at how clingy he seemed), and sent him hate-filled kakao talks.

""Sorry I'm late folks."" The familiar voice drifted into Jungkook's ears and he turned, ready to throw his phone at Taehyung.

""WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, KIM TAEHYUNG? DO YOU REALIZE WHAT TIME PRACTICE STARTS? AND DO YOU REALIZE WHAT TIME IT IS? THE FACT THAT MS. KIM BROKE HER LEGS AND IS IN THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN SLACK OFF LIKE A SLACKING SLACKER!"" Jungkook screamed.

""Calm down, Kookie. I was late because the line at Starbucks was super long. Plus, that guy at the counter was totally trying to pick me up."" Taehyung handed Jungkook a drink, and held up his. ""Look at this! He wrote his fucking number on my cup!""

""I don't give a crap and,"" Jungkook smacked his lips together and sighed. ""Wow, this is really fucking good.""

""Really? It tastes like ball sweat."" Taehyung scrunched up his face.

""Of course you know what ball sweat tastes like!""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP, JIMIN! GET A HOBBY YOU NO LIFE LOSER!"" Taehyung screamed dumping a whole sugar pack into his Starbucks.

""Do you just carry around packets of sugar?"" Jungkook asked, alarmed when Taehyung pulled out another.

""Yeah."" Taehyung replied, struggling to open the packet with one hand. ""So how far have you guys gone without me?""

""The first act, and a little bit of the second."" Jungkook replied, unknowingly downing his coffee in a mere thirty seconds. ""Shit, that's actually really good.""

""Pumpkin Spice Latte."" Taehyung drawled out, pulling out a crumpled script. ""What page are we on?""

""Fourty three."" Jungkook peered into the empty cup. ""Did you just turn me into a typical white girl?""

""Probably. I'll buy you another one after practice if you want. It'll help me shake off that creepy barista.""

""Deal.""

-

Jungkook was mad, no, he was furious. He paced around the stage, tapping his watch impatiently. It had been seventeen minutes since practice started and Taehyung, a.k.a. the second lead, still wasn't here. He had tried calling him four times, sent him five texts (in a row! If he wasn't so panicked Jungkook would've been mortified at how clingy he seemed), and sent him hate-filled kakao talks.

...Huh, deja vu.

Jungkook should probably get used to Taehyung's tardiness, but to be perfectly honest, he was annoyed. So when Taehyung burst into the room, obnoxious orange hair and all, Jungkook threw his phone at him. Which was not a good idea, considering the floor was wood.

""So I got you a White Chocolate Frap today."" Taehyung said. Jungkook shot a glare at him while nursing the new crack on his phone.

""Someone's touchy today."" Taehyung smiled before placing the coffee on the ground. ""It's not my fault you decided to go all wacko and throw your phone at me, bud.""

Jungkook suddenly felt really bad. He realized that for the past week, Taehyung had been buying coffee for him.

""I'm sorry. How about I make it up with dinner? I'll pay.""

""It's a date. I won't be late tonight. So where are we?"" Taehyung asked, ignoring the way Jungkook's cheeks flared up.

-

For once, Taehyung wasn't late, sporting a button down and some black skinnies.

""Look we're matching."" Taehyung smiled, pointing to Jungkook's similar outfit.

""#TwinsiesTuesdays."" Jungkook muttered, before sitting down and looking at the menu.

""Hi, my name is Yoongi and I'll be your waiter tonight, what can I get you?"" A waiter drawled out in accented Korean.

""Are you from Daegu?"" Taehyung asked.

""Yes?"" Yoongi looked at the orange headed boy strangely.

""Me too!"" Taehyung smiled widely, somehow getting a gummy smile from the grumpy looking waiter. The waiter and Taehyung talked for at least five minutes, leaving Jungkook amazed at how easily Taehyung made friends.

""So, why did you decide to buy me dinner?"" Taehyung asked when their food came.

""Oh, I felt bad about getting mad at you. And I've never paid you for coffee.""

""I'm willing to pay for you."" Taehyung replied, slightly blushing. An hour later, they were back on the streets.

""Sorry, but do you wanna get McDonalds or something? French food never really fills me up."" Jungkook shrugged.

""Same."" Taehyung laughed before grabbing Jungkook's hand and running to the red roofed restaurant.

-

Taehyung is a habitual man, which explained why he showed up to the penultimate practice, thirty minutes late, two cups held in his hands.

""You didn't even help set up the set."" Jungkook complained, taking a coffee from Taehyung.

""I came to help a bit, but you guys are already done."" Taehyung shrugged, before taking a sip. Jungkook took a sip of his coffee and threw his head back.

""What is this?"" Jungkook asked, reading the cup for the drink name. Instead, he grew pink, then red.

""It's a frap. So what page are we on?""

""The same one."" Jungkook answered before pulling Taehyung in for a kiss.

""Although I appreciate the kiss, I'd like to know the page. And a confession would be nice before you go all putting your lips on mine and shit."" Taehyung smiled, and Jungkook frowned.

""Huh? But you confessed to me?"" Jungkook frowned pointing to the cup. Taehyung's eyebrows furrowed as he read the cup. Jungkook's cheeks flared as he realized that he just kissed a guy without getting a legit confession from him. He was going to have to move schools, maybe even countries. Goodbye Jungkook, hello Juan.

""That goddamn barista. Who does he think he is, writing confessions on my Jungkookie's cup."" Taehyung moaned reading the confession. Then he looked to Jungkook. ""Eh, at least he's good for something.""

Taehyung smiled before pulling Jungkook in for a kiss.

""That barista can't hit on you anymore."" Jungkook snarled. ""He'll have to get through me first.""

Taehyung smiled before kissing him again.

""GET A ROOM!""

""GET A HOBBY FIRST, JIMIN!"""
5485625,2015,1016,161.0,4.0,"Write until it comes true

Jungkook loved his best friends, and for that he wanted them to be together, because he couldn’t help to see the way they looked at each other, to catch the longing in their eyes and the not so secret smiles full of hidden emotions. He knew they liked each other, he was sure they wanted to be more than just bandmates and friends, but reality was not as easy and being an idol had lots of disadvantages as well, having a relationship like that was too careless, too awkward, too risky, to be honest, it might never happen.

And he felt bad for them, he really wished for them to be a couple, to enjoy life as one like what he heard people write on countless fanfictions out there. Thinking of that, of these imaginary world were everything could work out, Jungkook ended up stumbling across some writings of them, and at first he didn’t mean to actually read them, but curiosity got the best of him, and a few thirty or something later he found himself crying over the most angsty thing he ever read and decided to stay away from those and the ones with sexual content also because he wasn’t that creepy.

Overall he grew quite fond of reading the ones with happy ending, it made him glad to know somehow, even if just among words, Jimin and Tae where finally together. But in a way, not always people would get them just right, I mean, it was totally understandable as they didn’t live with both of them like he did, but he craved for something more accurate, something that would describe the current situation as perfectly as he saw, then why not write one himself?

He stared at the blank page on his laptop screen, the cursor blinking waiting to fill the space with a story that could be read and told by everyone. Jungkook had no idea where to start, is not like he ever wrote something like this before, he started thinking back of all the moments his friend had, the cute interactions they had with each other, then suddenly his hands were fiercely typing and by the end of one hour he had more than eight pages of gay fanfiction about his own bandmates.

He felt embarrassed, cheeks flushing red, but at the same time as he re-read the text, he was proud of his accomplishment, it was like seeing them in front of him doing what it was described, and it was heartwarming he only wish it was true. Well, done for the day, he closed the lid on his laptop and got ready to sleep.

The next day they had a tight schedule but it didn’t stop Jungkook of imagining scenarios in his head, especially when the subjects of his writings were just close to him again being so boyfriends like, bet this would fuel at least another two pages. He laughed at his silliness, maybe he was getting way too much into this, so he decided that tonight after work was done he would go practice a few dance moves or something to distract himself from his fanboying over Vmin, he even used their couple name now, he needed help.

Jimin sat at Jungkook’s bed while the other was away, waiting for Namjoon to comeback as he said he wanted to discuss something with him. He looked over the pile of cloths threw around his mattress and saw a faded light from underneath, it was his laptop and it was on, he shook his head thinking how careless the maknae was with his stuff sometimes and opened the lid to at least put the poor thing to sleep, but his finger only hovered over the power button as he quickly scanned the text on the screen, it had his name on it and that was more than enough of an excuse to snoop around.

Namjoon saw Jimin flying from his room in the speed of light, he didn’t even had time to ask what was going on and just decided they could talk later.

Jungkook was on the floor, in the middle of stretching when his hyung barges in flopping beside him, gasping for air like he had been running a marathon, he looked so confused it scared him.

“What the hell was that about?” Jimin asked and it was his turn to be confused. “What were you writing about me and Tae?” Realization hit him and fuck everything because this was the most embarrassing moment of his life, even more than being caught masturbating since there’s always an explanation for that. “Jungkook, answer me!” He pressed and the younger had no idea what to say that wouldn’t sound disturbing as hell.

“I, I don’t know hyung, I mean, you read the thing, it’s pretty much that… I think you two like each other and I feel bad it never worked out… honestly, I don’t even know how to get myself out of this…” Jungkook chocked with his words, he felt like digging a whole across the world and bury himself in it, his hyung would hate him forever now.

“You think he likes me?” Well, he wasn’t expecting this kind of reaction though, he blinked at least four times before answering it.

“Yes, it’s pretty obvious I think.” Jungkook said and Jimin smiled shyly.

“Well, like you so expertly pointed out in your fanfiction, I like him too, so, can you… can you help me with it?” Jimin asked and it was so cute the way he blushed at his own request.

“Of course, I’d love to!” So the whole situation wasn’t as complicated and desperate as he thought, and all Jungkook had to do was play matchmaker and watch as his hyungs confessed and ended up kissing each other, just like how he wrote about it, I guess there was no point continuing his fanfictions now, or maybe he would write just one more and tell the outcome of their love story, and whoever read it would never know that everything was actually true."
36408319,2022,1011,17.0,8.0,"for the love (hate) of namjoon

“So, you like to talk to plants?” Namjoon was a peculiar being. Always so stupidly endearing and annoyingly soft. “Something like that”, responded Namjoon in his annoying i'm-not-listening-to-you-because-i'm-cutely-fixating-at-my-task voice. Hoseok had no categorisation of the types of Namjoon voices. Absolutely not.
Hoseok had met Namjoon in the horticulture class his professor had made him take for extra credit, when he could've easily taken a dance class. ""You'll find beauty in silence and amongst plants, Hoseok. Besides, you need the sun, look at how horrifyingly pale you are."", he had said. Hoseok had disagreed and tried to fight but his professor was annoying and he cared. So Hoseok had to oblige.
When he had first encountered Namjoon, he had been wearing blood stained overalls and thick yellow-turned-red rubber gloves. He, as Hoseok later got to know, had been helping out the nurse with a Meloidogyne infection one of the students had. Not once had Namjoon complained. He just sat there, rocking back and forth in his chair, chattering and humming to himself (memorising plant families, Namjoon had corrected), while pulling out small strands of the organism from underneath the patient's skin. How he did not get sick from just the sight was beyond Hoseok.
Hoseok had mistaken the department to be the medical one because of him. When he had asked to confirm if he was in the right department, Namjoon had laughed with this stupid, disgusting dimples out and told him, ""Yes, Sunshine, you're in the Horticulture department. Don't mind me, I promise I haven't murdered anyone. Not yet, anyways"". And horrifyingly winked. As if that was supposed to reassure Hoseok. Disgusting.
Namjoon was weird, Hoseok got to know. He talked to the plants the course made them plant. From rice paddies to jasmines to succulents. He caressed them and spoke kind words. He gave them little ""affirmations"" every single day, and told Hoseok about how talking to plants would make them grow healthier and live longer. Hoseok never really understood Namjoon, just nodded along to his fixation on how pests also deserved to live and how we must not let an impact on the economy affect how we treat living creatures. ""Pests are also creatures nature has blessed us with, Hobi. Why do we have to kill them?"" Hoseok never understood Namjoon.
Namjoon was stupid, Hoseok knew. He was weird and his dimples were annoying and he was lanky and broad and sexy and walked like he owned the land but also so so carefully as though he was trying not to trample on flowers that had been left along his path. He sounded like a fucking train and made Hoseok do practical work with him despite not a single student coming to class. He destroyed his sleep and gave him stomach cramps when he would laugh out loud and then cover his face out of shyness. He made his skin burn and liked making him have heart attacks when he would trip from getting tangled with his shoelaces.
Hoseok permanently had to worry about not being able to see Namjoon again from the amount of accidents he had on the daily (not that Hoseok wanted to see, this was just human courtesy). Just yesterday, when Hoseok had taken Namjoon shopping for something other than the disgustingly cute overalls he wore, Namjoon had gone on a monologue about systemic fatphobia while crossing the road. He had talked about how corporations chose different sizes for themselves in order to make people insecure about their body which would result in people going to gyms which benefited the health industrial complex. He had ranted about how people going to the gym implied the existence of cheat days which would induce guilt on individuals. This guilt would then reflect into binge eating fast food which would benefit the food industry and then cause us health issues and hence benefit the medical industry. Hoseok had lost three lives just from trying to prevent an accident.
It's not like Hoseok liked to hear Namjoon talk or even cared about things he wanted to say. Namjoon was, of course, annoying. Hoseok would never fall for such a disgustingly sweet person. Never in a million years would Hoseok fall for a person who did not know how to take care of themself, did not know how to tie their shoelaces. A person who either talked endlessly or remained silent until Hoseok's ears started ringing. A person who cared too much and smiled like the world had personally done him a favour by letting him meet Hoseok. Never.
Hoseok was currently listening to Namjoon go on about how the top 1% were gatekeeping basic resources from the rest of the world and how we must strive and work hard towards the revolution so that the working class or the ""proletariat"" (as Namjoon liked to refer to them as) can seize the means of production and distribute wealth and live a fulfilled life with their labour having more worth.
""Would you like to go on a date with me?"" Wait what? Oh fuck. That wasn't Namjoon. Hoseok was a certified idiot. He was mortified. Why did he say that? Why? Didn't he hate Namjoon for blurting random shit at random times? Why would he do the same? Oh God, even his head sounded like Namjoon. He had to stop. But, wait. Hoseok had asked Namjoon on a date, what the fuck was Namjoon saying?
Hoseok tuned into Namjoon's words and as expected, the moron had not heard him because he was talking about Reform or Revolution and how Rosa was 'communist as fuck' and that reformism was a bane to the existence of the proletariat and how it was just an illusion because the power was still in the hands of the bourgeoisie. ""The revolution must always be of utmost importance, Hobi."" Pretentious fuck. Hoseok was right about two things. First, Namjoon was disgustingly stupid and the second being that his professor was wrong. Silence had no beauty, it was haunting. He preferred listening to Namjoon drone instead. Annoying idiot.

Author's Note:

this is awful it has literally not plot at all but trans jungkook holds a special place in my heart so i needed to do something. i apologize in advance

jungkook wasn’t sure of what had motivated him to do what he was about to do. one day he woke up feeling good about himself, and then the coming out thing appeared in his mind and suddenly he was sure that he was really going to tell someone, finally. he spent months dealing with self-hatred and insecurity, but now he was (almost) certain that he was going to be able to open up to someone. he never really considered coming out before, sure he had some passing thoughts, but the real thing? no way.

in that moment however, jungkook wasn’t so sure anymore. his hands were sweating and his heart was beating a thousand times per minute at least, a hundred different outcomes were going through his head, coming out was one of those situations where you can never be sure of what’s going to happen. yoongi could have a great reaction, there was a chance of him comforting jungkook and telling him it’s ok. but there was also the possibility of yoongi thinking jungkook is a freak, that he’s too young to know and is just confused.

jungkook decided to move forward with the “plan”, if he didn’t do it now, he probably would drag it out until it was too late.

while he walked to yoongi’s house (where jimin and hoseok already were, thanks to some random school project), jungkook started to feel more and more anxious and insecure. that was his first time coming out to someone, he had exactly 0 experience in the field and literally no idea of what the consequences might be like.

jungkook chose to tell yoongi first because he was the only one in their group (up until that moment) who wasn’t straight, he’s well aware that their situations are very different, but since the day yoongi told them jungkook began to feel more comfortable around his friend.

it was a normal day, they were all hanging out together at recess and suddenly yoongi was standing in front of them, rubbing his neck nervously. while looking at his feet he said “so… i’m bisexual? i mean, yeah. i am.”

it was a cute scene in jungkook’s opinion, everyone was smiling and cheering and taehyung got up and hugged yoongi hard, who was having a difficult time trying to look like he wasn’t about to cry. jungkook felt a lot happier in that moment. he knew that he could count on his friends, he hoped that maybe they would react as good to his news as they did with yoongi's.

jungkook rings the doorbell, trying with all his being not to run away and give up. fuck why did he even think this would be a good idea? he was clearly wrong.

hoseok opens the door, energetic as always, “hey kookie! i didn’t know you were coming too.” jungkook goes in, feeling a bit out of place, obviously he shouldn’t be there.

“uhm, i really just came to talk to yoongi for a bit?” after his name is mentioned yoongi comes out of the kitchen, going to greet his friend.

“spill.” his tone is casual. jungkook feels like he can’t breath. suddenly he is 15x times more aware of his breasts and how they weight on his chest. he remembers how he isn’t tall and broad and his voice isn’t deep and fuck. he’s never gonna look like a boy, he's always going to be awkward and just the thought of it made him feel sick.

“is it ok if we talk privately? i really don’t want to bother any of you but it’s kind of important.” yoongi looks a bit suspicious, but he still says “sure” and takes jungkook to his room.

jungkook sits on his bed, while yoongi is standing next to the window, almost sitting on a tiny table he had, looking at him with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. jungkook breathes deeply and thinks it’s now or never.

“i’m a boy. i know it doesn’t look like it but i am, you need to believe it, yoongi. i’m a boy and my body is all wrong and-” but he’s interrupted by yoongi hugging him tight. he’s stroking his hair lightly and humming. of all the stuff jungkook had imagined this definitely wasn’t one of them. yoongi really disliked physical contact, and yet here he was, hugging jungkook like it was the most important thing he had ever done.

“it’s ok, jungkook, you don’t need to prove anything to me. i trust you.” his voice is soft as he ends the hug, but still holds jungkook close.

“it’s so hard… yoongi, i shouldn’t feel like this, i shouldn’t be trans but i am and it’s so fucking hard.” jungkook feels tears coming and he tries his best to hold them back but he can’t, because yoongi is tracing circles on jungkook’s lower back with his hand and he’s finally getting rid of some of the weight that was always bringing him down, making him feel bad about himself all the time.

“jungkook, this doesn’t change anything, and you know that right? we’ll always love you and if you need help we will always be there for you.” jungkook rests his head on yoongi’s chest, trying to calm himself down. he lets a small “yeah i do” out.

“listen, do you need me to do something? do you want me to use new pronouns from now on? if you want i can lend you some clothes? or take you to get a haircut?” jungkook smiles so hard his cheeks start hurting. he never imagined he would feel content in a moment like this. yoongi is looking at him expectantly and he's smiling too. jungkook thinks yoongi has a lovely smile.

“thank you yoongi, for everything.” jungkook feels like he’s dreaming, this is too good to be true, he's not even sure he deserves this kind of reaction. he’s aware it’s not always gonna be like this, that people will be hateful toward him, and they will harass him verbally and physically. but in that moment he had just gotten the support of one of his best friends and that’s all that matters.

“i think that for now the clothes and pronouns are good.” he smiles at yoongi, who ruffles his hair playfully.

“sure thing.”

Author's Note:

yesterday i got back home after watching No way home in the theater and let me tell you, the whole time i swear i imagined jungkook instead of tom holland like I wish i was kidding rn LMAAOOO because friendly neighbourhood spiderman as jk… IDK IT JUST FITS HIM SO MUCH!

and this was loosely based off his instagram story, the one he posted of bam and you can see his marvel and dc figurines at the back😭😭😭

!!THIS CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS OF THE MOVIE!!

Jungkook is a super fan of Marvel, Taehyung knows this. Everyone and their mom knows this.

He’s not that of a fan, sure he knows a bunch of superheroes here and there like the Avengers, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man—Iron Man is Jungkook’s favourite ever superhero, gushed over him for hours and cried buckets in the cinema when he died in Endgame (that one time he talked about some guy named Robert Downey Jr. and Taehyung had asked who he was talking about, and Jungkook had looked at him in betrayal, which he later found out Robert Downey Jr. was actually Iron Man -Jungkook refused to have sex with him for a week after that, to which he gave up on the second day and couldn’t resist shoving his dick in Taehyung that night), and currently—Taehyung is sitting in the theater beside a very devastated Jungkook, sniffing every few seconds at the big screen as he eats his popcorn so torturously slow.

Jungkook booked two tickets for Spiderman No Way Home a week ago, said nothing to Taehyung about it because of course he knows his boyfriend will follow him till the end of the world, whatever it takes. And he follows Jungkook, all puppy-love eyes because he loves him.

So here they are, finally arriving at the climax scene of No Way Home, presumably. And God—Jungkook just can’t stop sniffing.

The entire theater is sobbing, to be more frank.

The man with the red cape—Taehyung thinks his name is Doctor Strange, ironic because his magic is kind of strange—asks something to Spiderman; if he chooses to go with his decision, the entire world will forget him, and that includes his friends, family relations, his girlfriend MJ… but it would stop the bad guys from those other multiverse(?) from entering their universe, so it’s—okay, it’s so complicated. How the hell does Jungkook understand this thing?

But Taehyung guesses it’s kind of sad. Spiderman and MJ looked so in love, and their whole interactions are wholesome too—he’s not a Marvel fan, but only a fool would be blind to not let a few tears fall when MJ and Spiderman kissed in the end, with the sun rising above the horizon at the back and you could just feel the longing and yearning behind it, knowing the next time Peter sees her again he will be the only one left with memories. It’s bittersweet.

When the second end credits of the movie rolls in, everyone is clapping. It’s almost comical how these people are wearing the same expression as Jungkook’s—smiling contently, eyes rimmed red and Taehyung thinks he sees someone in front with snot in their nose too.

“That was…” Jungkook says as they step out of the theater, walking proudly with his Spiderman t-shirt and Spiderman jacket and Iron Man socks. “Amazing.”

Taehyung snickers. “I don’t really understand the Marvel universe, but yeah. That was amazing. Kudos to the animators too.”

Especially the scene where Spiderman suddenly started doing Math out of nowhere inside Doctor Strange’s mirror world. That had Taehyung mind-fucked.

“Oh God—you know—the part when Ned did the portal thing with Doctor Strange’s rings and Spiderman appeared at the end of it, I hadn’t thought it would actually be Andrew at all! I mean, I knew the other Spidermans would show up eventually, that’s what they all say, but that one completely— completely flew out of my mind! Like, why didn’t I think it would be Andrew at all?!” Jungkook rambles and sniffs, nose still red from crying. “And then Toby appeared and I died!—I actually died, and everyone in there just started screaming and my brain just… OMG, IT’S TOBY! Like, can you believe it?!”

He’s doing that thing again, where he starts nerding off about Marvel and his doe eyes turn all wide as he rambles, like a bunny. Taehyung doesn’t mind hearing his boyfriend ramble at all. Jungkook’s voice is lovely and Taehyung could go hours just hearing him talk about the things he loves, the things he’s passionate about. He looks happy about it and it makes him happy too (even though he doesn’t understand anything and just nods to whatever part he deems necessary).

“And the part where the news reporter with the big ass mustache—I hate him—went all, ‘Everything Spiderman touches destructs,’ nag, nag, nag, and Peter just hits rock bottom watching the billboard… his face, oh God, you should’ve seen his face…”

Taehyung chortles silently to himself and gives a low hum, agreeing to Jungkook’s words.

“But the humor was a solid 10/10. The entire plot just reminds me of that one Three Spidermans meme, where they all just point at each other and go all, ‘I’m Spiderman, you’re Spiderman, he’s Spiderman!’” Jungkook chuckles and slips a hand around Taehyung’s waist, pulling him close until their bodies touch. “What was your favourite part, babe? Mine’s everything about it—ah… I hope I’m not boring you with all of this…”

Taehyung giggles and shakes his head. Jungkook may be a superhero geek, but he is his superhero geek (the collections of Marvel and DC figurines intricately placed behind his glass shelf back inside his dorm room says so). “Not at all. I really enjoyed it and I think my favourite part was… the dialogues, I guess. It’s funny. I really liked the dynamic between Spiderman and MJ too.”

Taehyung just knows Jungkook is smirking from behind his mask. “You must’ve cried. You did, didn’t you? When they parted ways? Don’t think I didn’t hear you trying to hold back a sob.”

Taehyung rolls his eyes playfully, not even trying to deny it.

“Aww, a romantic sap, aren’t you?”

He is a romantic sap, thank you very much. It’s not his fault for crying over a couple that actually looks in love with each other as he and Jungkook are. For a hot minute there in his seat, he swears he sees a flash of their faces instead of Tom Holland and Zendaya. “Yeah, I am.” He boops Jungkook’s nose. “And you can be the Spiderman to my MJ too.”

Jungkook’s eyes crinkle first before he laughs out loud, a little bit drowned out by the low chatterings of the people around them. He pulls Taehyung closer by the waist, if that’s even possible—and says smoothly, “Babe, you should know even Spiderman and MJ can never rival our love.”

Taehyung’s face turns beet red and he hears someone at the back yelling, “Yo, get a room!”"

I'm here again
Just a silly little drabble I wrote.
Originally posted on twt but this is more detailed.

Pure Fluffff coming.

It's a good morning and jungkook woke up happy, and now he is walking towards the kitchen to grab the last bottle of banana milk before he has to go and get a new carton.

He kept the banana milk hidden behind the beers so the members couldn't drink it.

""good morning, Jin hyung""

""mornin kook"" jin mumbles still sleepy.

Kook walks towards the refrigerator and opens it, but lo and behold, he double checks and,

""HYUNG""

""YAAHH WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING SO LOUDLY"" jin screeches

""who the fuck drank my banana milk?"" jungkook huffs angrily.

""do I look like I drank it kook? I drank beer yesterday night not your baby milk"" jin says visibly irritated

""then who drank my banana milk?"" he stomps his foot angrily.

""I'm gonna kill that person, that was my last bottle and now I can't drink any"" kook says agitated

""go and ask your other hyungs"" jin mumbles. He nods his head and walks towards namjoon sitting on the couch reading a book.

""hyung did you drink the last bottle of /my/ banana milk"" kook says his anger spiking up.

""jungkook do you know one cup or a bottle of banana milk have an average 60 to 150 calories with 2 to 5 grams of fat, 7 to 20 grams -""

""JUST SAY YES OR NO""

""no I didn't drink it"" the elder mumbles clearly taken aback by the youngers words.

Kook huffs and walks towards the hobi and yoongi and jimin's room.

He barges straight in, not really caring about knocking when his morning got ruined.

Yoongi is still sleeping while hoseok is doing is morning routine,

""what happened kook-ah"" hobi asks sweetly

""did you drink my banana milk?"" hobi shakes his head no, confused by the question.

The maknae walks towards the bed and shakes yoongi, the elder groans eyes blinking open,

""what the fuck do you want kook? "" he mumbles in a sleepy voice, unhappy that he got woken up from his beauty sleep.

""did you drink /my/ banana milk?""

""seriously jungkook, you woke me up to ask if I drank your fuckin banana milk.. "" yoongi deadpans

""just answer min yoongi hyung""

""wtf no I didn't, I'm not a baby to drink that"" yoongi grumbles Jimin having emerged from the rest room after taking a bath looks at his boyfriend with questioning a look, hobi shrugs in reply.

Jungkook turns around and spots jimin,

""you, you drank my banana milk right "" the maknae says pointing an accusing finger at minie, his face red and angry Jimin blinks,

""you do know that I don't like anything that has banana in it, right? "" he says slowly.

""YOU ARE LYING, YOU DRANK IT, YOU DRANK MY BANANA MILK ""

""STOP SCREAMING JUNGKOOK, I SAID I DIDN'T DRINK IT"" jimin scolds.

Kook deflates, his eyes down cast.

""why don't you go and ask the others?"" hobi says softly placing a hand on the maknae's shoulder.

""jin and joon hyung said they didn't drink it"" the younger mumbles voice still a tad bit angry

""what about tae?"" jimin asks

""taehyungie hyung won't drink it?"" he states/questions

""go and ask him you idiot"" yoongi says sitting upright a frown etched on his face.

.

.

Jungkook walks out of the room and walks towards taehyung's room, he quietly opens the door not to disturb the elder.

But tae is already awake and sitting on the bed with the blanket wrapped around him, kook wants to coo at the sight but stomps inside the room and asks,

""did you drink my banana milk taehyung hyung? ""

Tae looks up with tears in his, kook freezes

""i-i'm sorry kookie, i-i was up late and got thirsty and i-i drank the m-milk"" tae sobs quietly, shoulders shaking with the impact.

Kook quickly climbs in the bed, ""omg baby, don't cry"" the nickname slipping easily

""i-i'm so sorry kookie, i-i'll get you.."" kook places his index finger on the elders lip.

Tae gasps and widens his eyes, lashes wet with tears, noes tinted red.

Looking beautiful as ever, jungkook thinks.

""shh sweets it's alright, I don't blame you for being thirsty. In fact next time you can drink all the banana milk and you'll never have to ask me at all"" jungkook wipes tae's tears and hugs the elder tightly.

""y-you aren't angry right? "" taehyung mumbles in his chest

""of course not hyung"" kook smiles placing a kiss on the top of his head.

""you wanna sleep more hyung?"" kook whispers.

Tae nods, ""I woke up because of your shouting""

He pulls back and lays down on the bed, ""will you sleep with me?"" tae mumbles cutely, big eyes staring at him.

Jungkook coos at the sight, he gets inside the blanket wrapping his arms around the elders slender waist.

Tae inhales sharply, ""you okay hyung?"" the younger asks.

Tae just snuggles in his arms putting his head on the maknae's chest.

He looks so fragile and beautiful in my arms, kook thinks.

He cards his hand through the elders hair, massaging the scalp lightly.

I wanna kiss him so bad

""can I kiss you?"" kook blurts out without thinking, flushing red when the elder looks at him with his sharp eyes.

Tae shifts closer to kooks face their breaths intermingling, he then places a chaste kiss on his lips.

kook stares shocked.

Did- did he just kiss me? kook's mind screams.

Tae snuggles back in his chest moving a bit to get comfortable.

""hyung"" jungkook whines jostling taehyung a bit.

""sleep bunny"" tae replies making himself more comfortable in the youngers arms.

""taehyungie hyungie hyung"" and the elder looks up, eyes shining with mirth and love.

Jungkook smiles and leans down, pulling taehyung in a searing passionate kiss.

""I love you"" the elders whispers against his lips.

""wha-what?"" kook stares cross eyed.

Their heart beats accelerated.

""I love you kookie"" tae says again pulling back cheeks dusted pink, gaze shy.

Kook leans forward pulling the elder in a kiss.

Kiss all teeth clashing and tongue suckling.

""I love you too hyung, love you so much"" the younger confesses

They stare at each other, basking in the confession.

""more than your banana milk?"" tae asks eyes mischievous.

""I love you more than my banana milk"" the younger replies in a heart beat.

Tae cups kook's face capturing his lips into another soft kiss.

A soft lazy kiss.

Both of them pouring their love in it.

And like this all thoughts of banana milk goes out of the window and in comes a story of love.

The Banana Milk Love.

Author's Note:

I had posted this on twitter
and just thought about posting it here as well.

It starts like a normal Sunday in the Kim-Jeon household.

Jungkook is munching on his cereals, sitting on the couch while Taehyung's head is on his lap. The rerun of some episode of ""New Journey to the West"" playing in the background.

Jungkook is so engrossed in the game being played on the screen that he doesn't notice the subtle ways in which his dear husband is reaching for the magazine - Cosmopolitan .

To be honest, the name and popularity of the magazine can fool anyone into believing that it is anything but useful. It truly is only useful in giving shitty ideas to Taehyung for their romantic, cute dates.

For some weird reasons (though Jungkook believes that it's mostly because of his best friend, Jimin's nonsensical belief in the magazine's editorial), Taehyung too religiously follows the magazine.

Last month, they tried making a cake from oreo biscuits. The keyword being tried ; because Taehyung is not good at cooking or baking and Jungkook had to attend an important phone call from work, so he left the kitchen for ten minutes when all the shit went down.

He came back to a burnt cake, flour splayed across every possible corner of their kitchen, and Taehyung, who was looking devastated at the destruction of their baking date.

And again, it had all started with the ""Cosmo"" because according to it, for a perfectmarriage, you should have had a cooking or baking date together; just for the sake of domesticity of it to be honest.

After that, Jungkook wanted to make sure that nothing like that ever happens again. He had to try very hard to coax Taehyung to not read that damn thing again, with a lot of pouting and kisses and cuddling.

But he knows that the elder can never resist the urge to read the magazine and Jungkook has tried to keep this month's magazine away from the elder's prying hands.

Really, he tried canceling the magazine's monthly subscription but they had a policy that in order to cancel the subscription, they will have to inform a month prior.

So here it is, the magazine lying in front of them, on the wooden table, as they're comfortably watching the television.

Or well that's what Jungkook had thought because clearly, Taehyung has other plans.

Reaching for the magazine, subtly rolling it to hide under his (Jungkook's) oversized shirt, and then standing up abruptly to flee away from the couch.

But Jungkook swiftly pulls his wrist to ask him where he is going. To which he very successfully (by stuttering half of his incoherent sentences) announces that he needs to use the bathroom and just runs away. Obviously, all the while holding the magazine firmly under his shirt.

Jungkook knows something is up with Taehyung as his husband cannot ever lie to him properly but he doesn't really ponder over it.

What could possibly be wrong, right?

So he goes back to enjoying the show.

Five minutes into the show, he hears an indignant screech of “Jeon Jungkook”, coming from somewhere near his bedroom.

Jungkook freezes in his place.

Taehyung rarely ever calls him by his full name.

So this could only mean two things: first, Jungkook forgot to empty the trash can (but as far as he remembers he did, in fact, empty it yesterday); second, Taehyung found something obscure in the Cosmos and has convinced himself that their marriage is a failure.

His gaze falls on the table only to find that the magazine is gone.

And not even a minute later, Taehyung is storming into their living room tightly clutching on to the copy of this month’s edition of Cosmo in his hand.

(It always is the Cosmo.)

“Our marriage is a failure,” Taehyung almost screams.

Jungkook sighs.

Of course.

“I thought we collectively agreed to not read that damn thing ever again,” he mumbles under his breath.

Certainly, he can’t say this out aloud. Because he very much loves his husband and it was part of their marriage vows to never let the other down.

So, he indulges in whatever made their marriage a failure , albeit a bit reluctantly.

He always does.

And he can never deny his husband of anything.

He knows for a fact that he is a thousand percent goner for his beloved husband.

Well, who wouldn’t be?

Let’s be real; Kim Taehyung is just too perfect for this world. And the way his eyes light up or the way his box-shaped smile becomes even wider whenever Jungkook agrees to do something cute (stupid) with him.

And Jungkook is not stupid to let go of the opportunity to make his lover happy.

So here they are in a hot tub.

In the middle of June.

June .

The editorial board really needs to learn about the timing of the things they want their readers to do.

Really, Jungkook can gladly teach them about it.

(He can never forget how last year, they had sat on the swing of their balcony to enjoy the scorching sun for a beach-like date in the middle of January, the peak of winters in Seoul.

They both just had their swimming trunks on, which didn’t make any sense but he didn’t have the heart to tell his husband that.

The wind was so strong that he was shivering and he knew that Taehyung was feeling that too but was too stubborn for his own good.

After faking some coughs here and there and convincing Taehyung that he is not feeling well, they had finally moved inside to dive into the pile of their blankets and cuddle.)

“This bath is too god damn hot.”

“This is why we can’t do cute things. You complain too much.”

“Baby it’s almost burning outside. Why don’t we do something else, huh?”

“But the magazine—”

“Love, what if we open our refrigerator and sit in front of it?”

“But what’s romantic about it?”

Jungkook can hear the whining in his husband’s voice.

He sighs, again.

“We can cuddle with a blanket in front of it, and even have ice cream. What say, baby?”

“Which flavor?”

“Cookie crumbs, your favorite.”

He can hear the gears turning in Taehyung’s mind and when he takes a deep breath and grins, Jungkook knows he won this time.

(Even if it means he has to stupidly sit in front of their fridge for an indefinite amount of time. Who cares if the fridge stops working after that!)

After all this mess, Jungkook made sure that no other copy of Cosmo ever reaches his husband again; he had to threaten Jimin as well.

But oh well, everything was worth it and worked out just fine after this.

— fin.

36695155,2022,1002,1.0,,"the wolves within

The teddy bear on Taehyung’s coffee cup grinned at him almost mockingly. It had a much better life than Taehyung even if a piece of his ear had been chipped off at one point. Taehyung was missing more than just a piece of his ear. He tipped the cup to stare at the coffee itself instead. He wasn’t quite sure why he was even drinking it; what he was trying to achieve. He was already awake, has been for hours.

“What’s wrong?” his mother asked, making him look up at her. He didn’t even need to ask why she asked. ‘You’re making the face’, she would say with a worried expression. He never made a face; it was just… his face. Either his mother was too used to him putting on a smile for her or maybe over the years the emptiness had managed to settle on his face; maybe it had buried itself in the wrinkles on his forehead; maybe it had carved him a completely new face.

He mustered up the last of his energy to lift the corners of his lips just slightly. “Nothing. Just tired.” Out of all of the lies that Taehyung told; lies out of convenience; lies to protect himself; lies as an effort to shield his friends from himself - this one was the worst. This one was the lie that gripped onto his throat and squeezed it so so tight that he struggled more and more to perform it well every time. There were tears trying to well up in his eyes right now too but he pushed them down like he always did.

Why are you crying now? Stop crying. This is not a reason to cry.

Lifting the cup of coffee to his face to hide his gritted teeth, Taehyung took a deep breath. That’s how you stop crying, right? Deep breaths. Happy thoughts. Well, Taehyung couldn’t do the happy thoughts so much these days which was what got him here in the first place.

There were two wolves within him. It was a meme but it was also an old story - and probably a lie he told himself to be able to live with himself. There were two wolves within him: one held all of his emotions, fighting to its death in an effort to just be allowed to feel them; the other one felt nothing as it was what it deemed safe. The two of them were in an endless chase, a game of tug of war. Taehyung was in the middle like a chewed-up toy that never got to rest.

There were the right amount of emotions he was allowed to feel. A balance. Apparently.

Balance was an unfamiliar concept for Taehyung. He didn’t like to admit it but his world was black and white - or red and blue; or white and yellow. One or the other. It was almost as if his insides were painted with water and oil. They couldn’t mix no matter how hard he tried, no matter how much he willed himself to be normal for once.

Once upon a time, there was only one wolf inside of him. The emotional one. Taehyung was good friends with it; liked to play catch with it until he was exhausted. When Taehyung felt emotions he felt them with his entire body; the emotions rushing through his blood and taking charge of every cell in his body. He used to think that it was the reason other people loved him - maybe that was the truth before he started to have emotions that weren’t all that fun.

Taehyung was the one who had raised the second wolf in an attempt to help himself balance his emotions, back then it had seemed smart. Having no emotions was surely better than having too many emotions. Except with both of the wolves in a constant battle, Taehyung was left in exhaustion; left in a struggle to keep both wolves at bay.

His friends were at battle too; with him; with each other, probably with themselves. Love was a powerful force but it wasn’t always stronger than your wolves no matter how many you had or which one you fed.

Maybe Taehyung didn’t have any wolves inside of him, maybe the wolves were his friends;

You shouldn’t listen to them. You should listen to me.

tugging at his arms;

I know better. I know best.

pulling on his sleeves;

They’re just manipulating you. You need to believe me.

clawing their fingernails into his skin.

If they knew what they were doing to him, they didn’t care. But Taehyung liked to believe they were just as clueless as him. They were not evil people after all. Just humans with a wolf within; or two or three. One day, he knew he was going to have to choose a side unless they decided to merge into the same side.

His mother once told him that fights like this brought people closer together. She didn’t mention that it sometimes tore people apart instead - that it would tear Taehyung apart.

There was no moral of the story. There was no one to blame. Except maybe himself.

Just as Sköll was chasing the sun, just as Hati was chasing the moon, there was no stopping the wolves. Not until you could choose who to feed. Not until you found a way to stop the fighting and find peace within yourself.

But as long as Taehyung was drowning in an ocean of self-pity, he couldn’t start that journey.

And first steps were the hardest ones to take after all.

“What are you thinking about?” Taehyung blinked back into reality. His mother was looking at him, a hint of worry shining in her eyes. He wondered whether he could catch a glimpse of her wolves if they’d be able to actually look at each other. “You’re so quiet.”

Taehyung exhaled through his nose, hoping she’d interpret it as a laugh. “I’m just dozing off sorry. I’m more exhausted than I thought.”"

Author's Note:

This is my first attempt at humor, please be kind akdjdkadjjdkska

The house was quiet, the open window letting in the night late spring breeze into the apartment as the cream colored curtains swayed softly.

The fish was resting inside his hollow decorative boat with only his head out of the entrance, soft water sounds from the filter in the empty living room.

The lights from the streetlamp illuminated the inside of the room, casting shadows on the couches and coffee table, entering the empty room by the bathroom.

Inside the other room in the house, three men snores quietly. One was sprawled on his back, bent leg thrown over the other's waist and hand under his pillow. The other was sleeping on his side, facing his boyfriend, hands tucked under the pillow and his own left leg thrown over the other's.

The third one was lying on the spare bed, having stayed up to play video games until much later. He was sprawled over the bed with his stomach down, right hand and foot hanging over the bed. The sheets, that were once covering all three of them, were either on the floor, or tangled in between legs and thighs.

Blinking his eyes open groggily, Taehyung took a few seconds to wonder why he was awake, when his heavy tongue registered on his brain.

Mindlessly, he untangled himself from his boyfriend, narrowly missing the bedside table, and stumbled over to the kitchen on muscle memory alone, leaving his glasses behind.

He walked past the table and couch, walking into the kitchen and past the counter to get himself water, eyes barely open.

He positioned the cup under the water filter clumsily, resting his temple and shoulder on the cool surface of the fridge. His eyes slowly blinked shut, head falling forward when the cup was half full, almost slipping from his hands.

He widened his eyes, shaking his head harshly to try and stay awake long enough to drink his water. He gulped it down quickly, leaving it on the sink and stumbling his way back into the bedroom.

When he was passing through the empty room, he saw a silhouette moving inside Yoongi and Jin's room, ruffling through the drawers.

He startled, adrenaline pumping through his body. ""Hey!"" He called, and the figure froze. ""What the hell are you doing inside! Get the fuck out of my house!"" He screamed at the man, who fled when he stepped closer. Adrenaline was pumping through his body, and he didn't even flinch as two pairs of steps ran over him, echoing in the quiet house.

""Hyung?! What is it? What happened?!"" Jungkook asked from behind him, and he finally turned around.

The boy had a baseball bat on his hands, eyes wide and darting around desperately to try and find the danger.

Jimin had his fists closed, breathing rapidly from being woken up so abruptly. ""Taetae, what happened?"" He asked, just a little bit calmer.

Taehyung pointed at the room's direction, stepping closer. ""There's someone in there! I didn't hear them run away, so they're still inside!""

The other two had a determined look on their faces as they followed him into the room.

Being the first one there, Jimin kicked open the door, slamming it into the wall. He apologized internally to Yoongi-hyung, but reasoned with himself that it was a necessary step to scaring the thief.

They stumbled inside the room after him, and Taehyung grabbed the umbrella Jin had forgotten near the door, swinging it around like a sword, ready to fight. Jungkook adjusted his grip on the baseball bat, standing diagonally behind Taehyung.

They looked around, kicking doors lightly with their toes and poking hanged coats.

When there was nothing, they exchanged silent glances, and Jimin looked meaningfully towards the bed.

Jungkook breathed in deeply, quietly lying down on his side by the bed, and held his breath as he swung the bad wildly under it, hitting a box and Yoongi's basketball in the process, but nothing else.

Taehyung opened the bathroom door with a slam, and hit the shower curtains open, but it was also empty.

Jimin was oddly quiet, standing in the middle of the room.

When Jungkook stood up and Taehyung came back, a little worried as to where the man had escaped to, Jimin softly brushed his hair back, still a little tense.

Just as he was about to ask another question, Taehyung pointed at the wall parallel to the door with a shout, raising his umbrella. He frowned as Jimin dropped held him back, standing in front of him.

""What?!"" Jungkook protested, looking three seconds away from hitting Taehyung with the bat instead of the intruder.

""TaeTae."" He bit his lip, expression as if he was going through a conflict of emotions.

""Hm?"" He answered, still confused as to why they were focused on him and not on the man.

""My love, that was your reflection."" Jimin groaned, letting go of his arms to bury his face in his hands in disbelief. ""You don't have your glasses on. You looked in the mirror and saw yourself.""

""Hyung!"" Jungkook exclaimed, dropping his bat on the bed. ""Seriously?!! At three and a half in the morning?!""

Jimin's shoulders started shaking as he laughed hysterically, and Taehyung's face fell into a sheepish smile.

""Sorry, Jungkookie."" He apologized, throwing his arms over his boyfriend and kissing his cheeks in apology. ""I'll ask one of you to get me water next time."" He giggled.

Jungkook rolled his eyes, still a little annoyed at being woken up in his fight or flight instincts for nothing. ""Let's just go to sleep."" He untangled himself from him, grabbing a still giggling Jimin by the waist and walking back to their room.

He dropped them on the bigger bed, burying his nose in his blond hair and throwing his legs over his hips.

Jimin smiled at Taehyung, who was on the door staring at them in disbelief.

""Hey! It's my turn to sleep with him!"" He protested, throwing himself on the bed on top of them both.

""No! You lost that privilege!"" The maknae tried pushing him off, but he nipped at his hands, wiggling into Jimin's arms.

""Now I'm already here, there's nothing you can do."" He smiled smugly, closing his eyes and squirming a little to get more comfortable in the awkward position.

""Three don't fit in the bed!"" Jungkook bluffed, but Jimin patted his head in a placating manner. He huffed, grumbling into the older's hair, and Taehyung giggled from his spot.

""You'll just have to accept my love tonight."" He giggled, protesting when Jimin poked his ribs painfully to make him stop.

""Fight tomorrow. Sleep now."" He closed his eyes, leaving no room for discussion with his kicks at their shins.

They obeyed easily, playfully poking at each other one last time before settling down.

At the living room, the fish was still trying to get his heartbeat back to normal to try and sleep again like three of his five owners, resting on top of a fake plant, hidden from sight.

In response to a prompt by
Anonymous in the NamjinGiftExchange2021
collection.

Prompt:

“We met over our hotel balconies and made an instant connection.” AU
G is the minimum rating, but they have stated that they are comfortable with an Explicit rating.
dnw: rape/non con, mcd, incest, underage, suicide, or mpreg.

“Baby, meet me at our balcony,” the text reads and Namjoon can’t hold back a smile. In a few minutes, he’ll be home with his lover, in the arms of the one who knows him best.

***

Knitting comes easy with Seokjin. The way the fibers intertwine is some kind of metaphor for the tangles in life slowly being woven together by some cosmic power to make sense in the end. Other than that, it is a hobby he picked up over the years of observing his mom and grandmother put smiles on the faces of people they love as they finish making knitted pieces. Even in his current vacation spot, he continues knitting on the balcony, the ocean waves waving at him from a distance.

At the edge of his vision, Seokjin sees a half-naked man emerging from the other balcony. Slowly, he adjusts the way he’s sitting, tilting his body slightly towards the other balcony, trying to get a better glimpse at the person there. For the record, Seokjin is a shy person, but he sure knows not to deprive himself some good sighting.

Said balcony neighbor brings along a book and proceeds to sitting on his balcony too, Seokjin’s staring seemingly unnoticed. The first thing Seokjin notices is the other’s almond eyes, all focused and intent on the reading material. As Seokjin’s eyes wander downward, he notices the good physique the other man has, and he feels his ears having a darker shade of red. He quickly snaps his head away, turning his attention back to his knitting.

But the fast motion does not go unnoticed. The balcony neighbor raises his head from reading, finally acknowledges Seokjin’s existence across him, and shouts out a “hello there”.

Seokjin, being an introvert and being embarrassed from getting caught staring, fights the urge to just ignore the voice and avoid the stranger at all cost. By some unknown force, he decides to stay and respond his own “hi there”.

“I’m Namjoon. How you been here for long?”

“I’m Seokjin. I just got here yesterday, taking a vacation from the busy city life.”

“Tell me about it. I’m also here for a break. Are you knitting? That’s so awesome. I couldn’t knit to save my life.” Namjoon laughs shyly at his confession.

“Yeah, I’ve been doing this for quite some time. An influence from the women of the life, my mother and grandmother.”

“Oh really? My mom likes knitting too.” As if imagining his mother knitting, Namjoon flashes a dimpled smile, making Seokjin more endeared than ever.

“Is she the type to knit sweaters for you, then?”

“Definitely. I go home after the holidays already expecting a box of sweater for me.”

“That’s so sweet of her. I could only do small pieces of knitted stuff. Anyway, what city life chaos are you escaping from?”

“The dreadful life of being a postgraduate student.”

“Oh, really? Can you believe that I just graduated from being a postgraduate student last week?” Seokjin lets out a heavy sigh as some of the hectic days from postgraduate days coming back at him.

“Wow, congratulations to you, Seokjin hyung. Oh wait, is it okay for me to call you hyung?”

Seokjin thinks he could get used to hearing Namjoon call him hyung. The freshness of this feeling captures Seokjin by surprise, and he tries so hard not to smile too hard and probably creep out the younger. He smiles timidly and mutters, “Sure, I’m not particular with formalities, anyway.”

Namjoon sighs in relief, seemingly afraid of crossing the imaginary line of first impressions and conversations. There is a palpable shift in the air between the two as a sudden gust of wind also comes across them, making Namjoon, who is not wearing any shirt on, shiver.

“Maybe you should put on some shirt or a sweater, Namjoon-ah,” Seokjin says after seeing the younger shiver.

Namjoon chuckles, his voice a tone deeper, “All right. Be right back, hyung.”

***

Namjoon and Seokjin stayed up all night talking about this and that, mostly dreadful memories from postgraduate studies. In the middle, Seokjin realizes how much pent-up emotions he tried to suppress to get things done and it is the first time he’s found the courage to let his feelings out.

Namjoon, being new to the postgraduate stress, is grateful to hear that he’s not alone with the anxiety he feels about all of it. And it sure does help getting advice from a handsome graduate. He finds himself not taking his eyes off Seokjin throughout the night.

That morning, Seokjin wakes up while still feeling sleepy. A random flash of gorgeous smile with dimples he wants to poke comes to his mind. He smiles too.

After some minutes of zoning out, he gathers his strength to greet the sun outside, stepping out to the balcony. At the edge of his vision, he notices Namjoon at the other balcony.

Unlike him, the younger seems to be awake for hours now, wet hair and new clothes like he just stepped out of the shower.

“Good morning, hyung. Enjoying the holiday breeze?”

“Good morning, Namjoon-ah. Actually had to force myself to go out and get some morning sunshine before I get the urge to coop myself inside for the whole day.” Seokjin laughs at his confession. And soon, Namjoon is laughing with him.

Namjoon walks closer to Seokjin’s balcony edge and stares at him. “Hyung, I have some emergency back at the city and I need to go back today. I don’t want to be too forward, but I really hope that we could get together some time when we get back to the city. I hope to get to know you better.”

Seokjin looks back at Namjoon’s eyes, drowns in the warmth they give off. “Of course, Namjoon. I’d love that too. Lunch is on me the next time we meet at the city.” This time, Seokjin does not hold back the widest smile he has.

***

The rest, as they say, is history.

Namjoon opens the door to their now shared apartment. Scent of recently cooked food drifts across the room. Up ahead, there is a silhouette of a man standing at the balcony.

Namjoon walks faster. By the time he crosses the door to the balcony, Seokjin has meet him halfway, arms open for the hug he’s been waiting since leaving home that morning.

“Welcome home, baby.”

For my most precious all time favourite Saphyeon.

Hi guys!

I just wanted to let you know that you shouldn't have high expectations since this is the first time ever I'm publishing a fanfic. Furthermore, English isn't my first language, please bear with me. You are free to point out any mistakes though, I want to learn and get better at writing, so any feedback is highly appreciated :)

And shoutout to my wonderful friend Saphy who's one of the reasons why I started writing drabbles in the first place. If you like any of my works, she's the one you should thank :D

With that being said, I hope you enjoy this short but very fluffy drabble!

“Hey Kim! Kim! Kim, wait up!”

Several heads turned around, looking at a boy who hurried past all of them. They didn’t matter at this moment. Neither Ravenclaw’s prefect Kim Namjoon nor Hufflepuff’s chaser Kim Minsu and even less Hogwarts’ head girl Kim Yongsun. Though he was indeed looking for a Gryffindor, he needed a boy. The school’s head boy, to be more precise. He was just a few steps ahead but for some reason he didn’t stop or even turned around. Jimin fastened his pace as he called out again.

“KIM SEOKJIN!”

Finally, the head boy turned around, surprise written all over his face. Why was that boy shouting at him?

“Jesus, are you deaf? Why don’t you react when people shout your name?!”

“Someone was calling me? Sorry, must have been lost in thought. What happened?”

Jimin rolled his eyes at the oblivious boy. “Someone is me. Taehyung wants to see you.”

“Why can’t he come find me himself then?”, Seokjin furrowed his eyebrows, being partly worried and partly sceptical.

“I don’t know, you should ask him, not me. He’s waiting at your “usual” spot, wherever that might be. He said you’d know.”

Seokjin nodded. “Thank you for telling me, Jimin-ssi.”

“You’re welcome. I’ll have to go now. Quidditch practice. See you later!”

With that he hastened away even faster than he had come.

“Hey, what’s up Tae? I thought we’d meet after our afternoon lesson.”

His best friend stood in front of a wall. It was no ordinary wall, it was special, filled with witchcraft and wizardry. Not many people knew about it though. Some might be lucky and find out about it by accident, others might have nice friends that shared such secrets with them. However, the majority of the staff and students really had no clue what magical powers were hidden inside these walls which made it the perfect place to meet up and just be together without having to put up with offensive remarks that invalidated both their privacy AND friendship.

“Sorry, Jinnie, this couldn’t wait any longer.”

The wall started to deform and for the first time since they used this room, a gate appeared. Seokjin didn’t ask any questions, expecting to get explanations once they would have entered the room.

He followed his friend inside but when he first stepped into the “room” he froze on the spot. His eyes wandered over the walls which were blooming with flowers in every possible colour. Left and right stood trees with cherry blossoms. In a corner of the room even stood a small fountain, sprinkling water. The beautiful and definitely unexpected sight took Seokjin’s breath away. It was mesmerizing.

And in the centre of the spectacle, on top of all the flowers that covered the entire floor, there lay a pretty plaid picnic blanket with a small basket right next to it.

“Tae- what is this?”

Still captivated by the beauty of the room he waited for an answer, trying to take everything in. When Taehyung didn’t say a word, he finally managed to tear his gaze away from the walls and looked at his long-time best friend expectantly, noticing for the nth time that he was even more enchanting than the room could possibly ever be.

Taehyung sat down on the picnic blanket gesturing towards Seokjin to join him, which he did without even hesitating. The room fell silent, no more exploring footsteps to be heard.

Seokjin kept looking at the younger, still waiting for an answer, when he finally locked eyes with him.

“Jinnie-“, he started but broke eye contact right after. He closed his eyes for a second and took a deep breath. Jin waited patiently, worrying. Taehyung then looked up again. He took Jin’s hands into his own before he began to speak.

“Jinnie-“, he started again, hesitating for a moment but then continued, “I’m sorry. All of this is so sudden but Jimin taught me something very important today. You surely know that he and Jungkook got together yesterday, right?”

“They what?” Jin stared at him in disbelief. These two idiots had been pining for each other for at least a year or two and their group of friends had already lost their faith in them. They had tried to set them up so many times it had become hopeless. So of course, Jin was surprised, now that he heard this.

“Jimin finally brought up the courage to tell him how he feels and apparently Jungkookie told him that he was scared that he lost his crush once again.”

“Again?”, Jin repeated, curious about the whole story.

“Again. In the past he didn’t take the chance to confess to his crush when it was right there and soon enough, he found out that another friend confessed to him and that they then were dating.”

“That sucks. But wouldn’t it have been awkward when he would have confessed but wouldn’t have gotten his feelings returned?”

“No, because if he had confessed first, everything would have been different and there might have been a chance of them getting together instead. Though it’s good he didn’t confess because now he has Jimin and vice versa. ANYway, point is, you should take a chance at first grasp, you can’t just put it away and take your time, it won’t wait for you forever.”

“What are you saying, Tae?”

“So, today, right now, I’m taking my chance because as a person who is not only good-looking and handsome but kind and wonderful and hundred more things which I can’t list now since it would take forever, you could take literally anyone as your partner any time. But I don’t want you to have anyone as your partner, Jin. I want to be your partner.

Kim Seokjin, I love you. I cherish you the most, you’re always there for me, even when I’m in my worst state of mind, you comfort me; you take care of me. You never fail to make me laugh and I really don’t care what others think, never stop with the dad-jokes. You are my sunshine, my dream and whenever I look at you or think about you, I can’t help but smile. You light up my world like dynamite and I don’t want life to go on without you. I don’t ever want to lose you, Jin.

And it’s totally okay if yo-“

A sudden pair of lips on his own cut him off, not letting him continue talking about ifs. The kiss was shy and innocent, soft but strong enough to convey their feelings for each other. Jin squeezed Taehyung’s hands which made him realise that he was still holding them. They both smiled into the kiss until Jin detached himself for a moement. Their faces were just inches apart when he whispered a quiet “I love you too, Kim Taehyung” and closed the gap once again.

“What are you getting so worked up? It’s just Jihoon sunbae you’re meeting.”

""Exactly, Jimin! First impressions are important! I have to very carefully think about what to do and say to give myself the best chance at making him fall in love with me, you know?""

""You sound insane, you know that, right?"" Jimin looked up from his computer looking at the panicked Taehyung.

“I don’t! Look I don’t wanna mess this up like my other dates. Plus the fact that I Jihoon sunbae was the one who asked me out on a study date, right before I could ask him out.""

“You’re still hung up on Seokjin hyung, aren’t you?”

“Seokjin? My asshole ex?”

“He was your best friend Taehyung.”

“Yes! Was! Exactly! I was foolish to let him lead me on, just for him to cheat on me. And did you know what he said after I caught him? ‘You deserve better’ Jimin, is it wrong for me to call him an asshole?” Tears pooled in Taehyung’s eyes threatening to spill as every second passed.

“Taehyung but still, this isn’t the way to cope.”

“What do you mean?”

“You know what I mean. Every single person you went out with all had something similar to Seokjin hyung. You can’t deny it.“

———————————————

“What are you doing?” Seokjin hissed at the sudden coldness against his waist.

“My feet are cold, so I’m warming them!”

“By putting them against my waist?” Fondness was evident in his eyes.

“Move your hands! You’re warm and comfortable ”

Where did it all go wrong? How did it become this way? His first relationship. 3 years down the drain.

Being used to waking up next to him made Taehyung feel light, warm and homey, but now all he feels is a void, ice-cold, suffocating him.

———————————————

Taehyung bit his lips, dry and cracked, waiting for Jihoon sunbae to show up at the cafe he once used to frequent when he was with Seokjin. He vowed to never go back to places they frequented, yet he broke it.

The café’s name ‘Autumn Leaves’ felt fitting to its aesthetic, beige walls with orange leaves that filled the ceilings, making the colours in the café warm and homey. Autumn was no doubt chilly to Taehyung, but he loved the way how the leaves becomes flaming orange, falling freely without any tension. But now just like how the leaves crumble in his hands, his relationship crumbled with Seokjin, autumn reminded him of the person he was with before, and he felt bitter.

The barista remembered him and silently nodded to him as she placed some strawberry rolls on his tray.

Strawberry rolls, sweet yet bitter just like his memories.

———————————

""Hyung! That was my last roll.” A pout came across Taehyung’s lips as he whined about Seokjin eating up the last roll.

""Hyung! What are you doi-"" Seokjin kissed Taehyung so dearly, allowing him to taste the lingering sweetness of the fresh strawberries.

""It tastes exactly like what I like. Soft, plush and strawberry flavoured.” Seokjin gave him an innocent smile.

‘’You said you wouldn’t break my heart, and then that’s exactly what you did. Kissing your ex like there’s no tomorrow. And you say I deserve better.” Taehyung scoffed as he took another bite of the roll.

——————————-

“Stop! Just stop it! Is kissing your ex a joke to you? That is the dumbest excuse I have ever heard!” Taehyung screamed painfully at the guilty Seokjin.

""When did you stop loving me? When was the last time you said you loved me and meant it?"" Tears welled in Taehyung’s eyes. Three years of loving him just went to waste in just one night.

“Tae, I’m so sorry. This whole thing of kissing my ex was just an accident. Please I need you. I have never stopped loving you, even for a second.”

“You’re not allowed to say you need me. It doesn’t matter. I don’t need you. I’m glad I finally get to see who you are. I gave you my heart, my everything, but did you give me anything in return?” Taehyung scoffed.

""Tae. Tae hear me out. Please.” Seokjin voice cracked, choking with unshed tears in his eyes.

“Don’t. I'm a fool for believing you before. It would be better if you stayed away from me. You’re the worst thing that has ever happened to me. You’ve destroyed me.”

Wiping unshed tears from his eyes, Taehyung quickly shot a text to Jihoon telling him something came up, apologising for the last-minute ditch.

Harshly wiping the tears that continued streaming down his face, Taehyung picked up his pace, running to the place where he feels safe.

Seokjin

No matter how much he denies it, Seokjin was always his safe place. Whenever he needed comforting, he ran to Seokjin. Whenever he felt sad, he ran to Seokjin.

He was a hypocrite, telling Seokjin to stay away from him but here he is going back to him. Jimin was right, he was never over Seokjin, even from the time they broke up. And before he knew it, he ended up at Seokjin's apartment.

“Taehyung? What are you doing here?” The voice that Taehyung was yearning for echoed in his ears. He suddenly felt all the emotions clashing in his heart making it overwhelming.

Sinking into his knees, the tears that were pooling in his eyes burst, streaming down his face, breath staggering, heavy and unsteady.

“Taehyung-ah. Look at me okay? Don’t take your eyes off of me. You’re going to be fine, yeah? You’re gonna be fine” Seokjin’s soothing voice filled his surrounding.

“Please don’t leave me.” Taehyung managed to whisper out holding Seokjin tight by his coat.

“I’m here for you, okay? And I’m never going to leave. Never again. You have always been my light, Taehyung-ah.”

“…I’m tired of blaming you for everything.” Taehyung was tired of it. He was tired of feeling guilty. He should have given Seokjin a chance to explain that day, but he didn’t.

“Tae, I–”

“I don’t like- I don’t want to hate everything, to hate you, all the time. And you know, I never hated you. Even after everything that you did, I never hated you and I hated myself every day because of that.” Taehyung quickly added on before his emotions got the better of him again.

“Do you think we can… start over?” Taehyung looked at Seokjin’s eyes that holds fondness in them then and now.

“I… There’s nothing I’d love more.” Seokjin gave him a smile which Taehyung knew that they were going to be okay.

“This… This feels right. Being near you- It feels like the puzzle piece I was missing.”

Their end hadn't been pretty, but now, standing in front of each other and looking in each other's eyes, it didn't feel strange - it felt right. Like they were finally where they belonged.

Author's Note:

yet another namseok universe

Groaning as he rubs his dry eyes, Namjoon leans back into the soft cushions of his couch and wonders if his career is worth going insane.

He’s doing some studying for his current book, one that will either be the death of his career or a life changing story.

He’s enjoys being able to create his own world and league of characters, but he wasn’t prepared for the endless amount of research that came with it.

Namjoon wants so badly to be the next big author, but honestly, if he has to face one more failed book campaign, he may start pulling out his hair. He’s at his wits end to make this work.

He closes his folder and rests it on the coffee table before taking off his glasses and resting them on the file, and then props his sock covered feet up. His head is starting to hurt, most of his day being filled with uncertainty and an ungodly amount of research.

Namjoon knows he needs more than a few hours to process and remember everything he’s just crammed, but he also knows that it’s Saturday, and he should be relaxing. Instead, he forced himself to study a subject he isn’t sure will even work for the story and will forget almost every detail in a day.

“Namjoon?”

He cracks one eye open to see his beautiful Hoseok waddling from the bathroom, dressed in pajama pants and a long shirt, steam flowing out behind him from his shower.

He’s wringing with his small hands while Hoseok slowly approaches him, and Namjoon can feel himself fall a little more in love with him. He’s so beautiful, even if there’s something pestering him.

“Yes, baby?”

Hoseok hesitates and lowers his eyes before answering, “Are you almost done?”

Namjoon forces a tired smile up at him, forgetting the ache in his head and twinge in his eyes, and drops his feet to lean forward.

He gently rests his hands on Hoseok’s round belly, the fabric of his thin shirt warm against his palms, and he feels their little baby move under the older mans skin. The baby tumbles and kicks, but not too much, just enough for the one carrying it to blow out a deep breathe, and Namjoon rests a hand on his back.

“I think I am. Why?”

Hoseok shrugs, letting a band drop so he can rest it on his very visible bump, and replies, “I’m tired.”

Namjoon stands and kisses the toothpaste flavored lips of his husband, going slow the entire time because he doesn’t want to spoil Hoseok, before leaning back down to collect his files and papers that he isn’t even sure are in the order.

He piles them all together, their importance lost as the man before him is more important to him, and moves them to the small mobile filing cabinet that Namjoon usually keeps in the coat closet. He shoves it into the corner of the room, making a mental note not to forget it before the night is over.

“Alright,” the taller man sighs, sitting back on the couch, “come here.”

Hoseok shuffles nervously before sitting on Namjoon’s lap, the taller man taking the others hips in his hands to guide him where to sit. Hoseok sits comfortably but a little stiffly across his lap, one arm around his shoulder, and the other lifts his shirt to expose his belly, and Namjoon’s soon joins his.

Then, just as soon as both parents hands are on the Hoseok’s belly, the real movement starts.

It’s little flutters underneath Hoseok’s skin at first, barely detectable to even the authors hands, and Hoseok moves Namjoon’s hands a few times at even the slightest shift. They get a little harder as a few moments pass, and Namjoon feels a few kicks against his palms before one really aggressive one makes Hoseok’s skin expand.

They both gasp when a little foot appears just above the older’s belly button, the clear indentation of little toes and a heel of a little foot.

“Hey, pea,” Namjoon whispers lowly to Hoseok’s belly, “did you miss appa?”

The baby delivers a harsh kick to where it’s foot was previously seen, the little print of it coming out again.

“She’s big. I can feel her every time she shifts when you talk to her.”

Namjoon chuckles at Hoseok, leaning up to press a few kisses to his cheek, before returning his attention back to their little angel.

He lives for moments like these, where he can shove his job aside and just enjoy time with his growing family, his beautiful Hoseok and their equally beautiful baby that has yet to arrive. It shouldn’t be long now, a few weeks maximum before the baby decides to make its grand entrance, and turns everyone’s world upside down.

He can’t wait to see their little bundle of joy. Even more so, he’s ready for Hoseok to go back on his meds.

Hoseok can hardly function these days without some assistance from Namjoon. He swears he sees and hears things that aren’t there, and sometimes their daughter talks to him when it’s really dark at night.

It worried Namjoon at first, but with Hoseok being unable to be on his meds while pregnant, he’s learned to handle it with grace.

“I need to talk to Yoongi about taking some days off in a few weeks,” the taller man says, his hand rubbing softly over the stretched flesh of Hoseok’s belly, “so when pea gets here, you won’t be alone.”

Hoseok huffs and pushes back some of his husbands hair from his face, he doesn’t say anything because there isn’t anything more to say.

Namjoon wants so badly to just stay home for the remainder of Hoseok’s pregnancy because he’s already missed so much, his job taking him away at times, and he feels like he’s let Hoseok down. He needs to be there for his partner and baby, and he wishes he could put his job on hold for an extended period of time without financial consequences.

“We need the money.”

Namjoon sighs. “I know.”

Hoseok shifts and lays his head on Namjoon’s. “I’m sorry.”

For what, Namjoon doesn’t ask. He knows. Hoseok feels guilty for something he can’t control.

He can’t help that his mind is his enemy.

So, Namjoon just rubs Hoseok’s belly and kisses his cheek. “You need to eat before we go to bed.”

Hoseok nods stiffly, his eyes flittering around and widening when they land in the corner or the room. “O-okay.”

“There’s nothing there, baby.”

Hoseok nods again and sniffs. “Okay.”

hello ♡

this taegi is from a puppy in a thornbush universe, but i think this could be a standalone drabble. you don't have to read the story to enjoy this.

(to piat readers: i don't have a specific location for this snippet in the main timeline, so you're welcome to squeeze it in wherever you'd like. it's just a cute little cuddle taegi for your winter enjoyment.)

hop in and enjoy!

Yoongi groans as he wakes, not by choice, he doesn’t think. It’s rare that he gets to sleep for a long period of time but not often that he doesn’t sleep through the night, always knocking out until his alarm blares and Seokjin barges in complaining about the noise.

It takes him a second to figure out why he’s awake, then two seconds of mild panic when it sinks in that he can’t move. Apart from his ankles, left arm and head, Yoongi finds himself quite literally molded into his bed. But his heartbeat smoothes down when, disrupted by all his wiggling, the force pinning him down sighs and shifts, giving him a brief reprieve. Cold air swarms between their bodies as the thick blanket over them gets pulled slightly and Yoongi feels goosebumps rise through his skin. He doesn’t doubt that Taehyung feels it too, though the younger is too far into dreamland to be complaining.

(It already took him a while to stop complaining about the cold — since Seokjin had turned off the apartment’s heating when they left — before they fell asleep, which is probably what prompted this lopsided stacked pancake position of theirs.)

Yoongi pulls an arm free from the confines of Taehyung’s and his own chest, fingers eagerly landing among his boyfriend’s thick, wavy hair. Whatever Wings’ in-house team have done for Taehyung is working wonderful, he thinks. Taehyung’s hair has been the softest he’s ever touched. Taehyung doesn’t stir from the fingers running through his hair, so Yoongi continues his ministrations. He finds himself enjoying it as much Taehyung does, finds it soothing, and of course Taehyung has never complained, instead seeking the gentle strokes with a content smile. They don't get to enjoy times like this often anymore; their schedules conflicting and what little free time they do have available never match up enough to be together just the two of them. They've made the best of it, as much as they can (to the teasing and faux gagging of their friends), but it doesn't mean that Yoongi doesn't miss his boyfriend terribly. He intends to fully cherish this pocket of time they somehow managed to put together last minute.

Yoongi’s other hand rests at the dip of Taehyung’s waist, just barely, given the angle of their position. He twists his wrist from side to side, pads of his fingers lightly playing over his boyfriend’s skin. It eventually makes Taehyung shiver, just as he intended, and he swallows his chuckles when Taehyung shifts again, limiting his hand even more.

Still, Taehyung is fast asleep.

Yoongi huffs quietly, blowing up a portion of Taehyung’s curls that is not under his gentle assault. As he watches them float down to their original position, he feels Taehyung’s lips moving against his nightshirt collar.

“Hmm?” Yoongi hums in question, can’t quite make out what his lover is saying.

Taehyung mumbles again, low-toned words lost among blanket, hair and cotton pajamas surrounding them.

This time Yoongi does chuckle, straining his neck to get a better look at his boyfriend. His fingers in Taehyung’s hair stop moving, keeping a group of curls off his forehead and keeping them there. “What is it, baby? I can’t hear you.”

“Hyungggg…”

Taehyung whines, groaning, stretching and wriggling away from Yoongi in a way that makes him laugh. The younger’s face is etched in mild displeasure as he burrows lower under the blanket, eyes never opening.

After a few seconds of silence, Yoongi thinks that’s the end of it, more entertained by what he thinks is sleep-talk than he expected. He reaches under the covers and runs a wide palm directly down Taehyung’s spine, exposed to him now that the younger has bent himself to fit under the blanket. He doesn’t expect a strong finger to poke him in the side, making him yelp in surprise.

“What was that for?”

Taehyung whines again, “Stop trying t’wake me… wanna sleep in.” He gives another hard poke, sending Yoongi jumping a palm’s distance away, taking their blanket with him.

“Hyungggg!”

The desperate whine at the blanket displacement only sets off Yoongi’s giggles, excused by a continuation of the tickle attack.

“‘m sorry, sorry, c’mere,” he coos, even when mirth taints his words and he finds himself growing more awake. He’s not sure what time it is; a glance towards the covered windows don’t tell him much either, just that it’s still dark outside. Yoongi may not be able to go back to sleep anymore but he knows Taehyung deserves a good long sleep-in after the week he has had.

He bodily pulls the younger closer when the man reaches over to grab a handful of his cotton top but does nothing more. Taehyung helps only a little — the move more of a drag than a lift, sleepy enough to not mind the consequence of awkward sleeping postures. Belatedly, Yoongi feels a bit guilty for having purposely tried to tease him awake. He wraps himself around his boyfriend, a secure cuddle in apology, chest warm when he feels Taehyung melt into his body with a content exhale.

Even so, he can’t help himself after a few silent minutes. “Tae?”

Taehyung responds with a hoarse hum, barely audible even in their quiet bedroom.

“Your birthday is coming up, want anything in particular?”

Taehyung is quick to answer, fingers finding home in Yoongi’s waist once again. “Sleep.”

Yoongi can’t help but laugh as his body jolts involuntarily, jostling Taehyung enough that he stops pressing into the muscle. He begins to card his fingers through Taehyung’s hair again, lightly scratching at the base of his head once in a while.

It’s mindless and soon Yoongi finds himself drifting too, breaths in tune with Taehyung’s against his shoulder. Right as he thinks he’s joining Taehyung in slumberland, Taehyung tilts his head up, nose just shy of Yoongi's chin. Then,

“And you.""

Because Taehyung still has his eyes closed, Yoongi presses his smile to the younger’s forehead, etching his answer into his skin with the same breathy whisper.

“You have me forever, puppy.”

Author's Note:

I obviously love Home Alone 2

You were never good at goodbyes, you avoided them at all costs. But it wasn’t something you could always get away from.

“I promise you that we’ll be back together as soon as possible,” Taehyung assured as he gathered you into his arms.

You knew that a long distance relationship was going to be hard to begin with but you were determined to make it work. The times spent together were worth the pain and sadness of the time apart. At least that’s what others said and what you tried to convince yourself. But you were starting to realize that each goodbye was harder than the last. Every time you left each other it felt like another piece of your heart was left behind and frankly you were running out of pieces.

“I don’t want you to go” you sobbed into his sweater. His grip around you tightened, his face burying into your hair. It was hard for him too but he always tried as hard as he could to keep it together for you. But as you let your emotions out, he felt his own sadness starting to get the best of him.

“I promise that I’ll be back as soon as I can, or I’ll fly you out to Seoul” he assured you, kissing the top of your head, “I can’t stand being away from you either”

“Let me come with you now” you pressed.

“You can’t” he stated, “It’s Christmas, you need to be with your family. They would be crushed if you weren’t there”

“Then stay. Stay and spend Christmas with me and my family. You know they love you and wouldn’t mind an extra person!” You suggested and for a second you actually convinced yourself that it was a possibility. Taehyung joining you at your parent’s house for the holidays, baking cookies, watching Christmas movies, opening gifts. It was the perfect fantasy.

Except a fantasy is all it was.

“I can’t, babe” he said softly. His hands moved to your cheeks as he lifted your face to look at him. Your entire complexion and eyes were red and splotchy from the tears that were continuing to fall from your eyes.

“Yes you can!” You kept on but you were only met with a sad, sympathetic smile from Tae.

“I can’t” he said again with a firmness behind his voice, “I begged to have this week with you. We have a comeback coming up and the other guys are working so hard on everything. I need to be there for this”

You dropped your gaze at his words, you already knew all that and agreed. Your relationship was hard enough without it driving a wedge in his career. While he loved you and any time he got with you, his respect and commitment was just as important and you knew it. In fact, you encouraged it.

“Next Christmas we’ll be together” he told you, “I promise”

“Don’t make promises you can’t keep” you told him with a pout. His smile softened as he brought your face back up to his once again. It was hard to be upset when Taehyung smiled at you, the way his emotions read in his eyes were always so genuine. It calmed your fears and insecurities.

“I always keep my promises” he whispered, leaning down to place a gentle kiss on your lips. Just knowing that this was the last time you would be able to hold him, kiss him, even just hear his voice in your ear was enough to bring tears back to your eyes despite everything in you trying to stay strong.

As Taehyung pulled back he saw those tears once again, “baby, stop crying!”

“I-I’m sorry, I just hate this so much” you hiccuped. Your eyes closed tightly to try and stop what felt like the endless stream of tears from falling. Tae pressed his forehead against yours, a deep sigh escaping his lips. He hated seeing you cry and the guilt weighed heavy on his heart.

“Hey” he said softly, “I have something I want to give you”

You two had already exchanged gifts for the year along with a birthday gift for him. Why would he have anything else to give? And why did he wait until now to bring it up?

You backed up a step as he dug his hand into the large black duffle bag that hung from his side. You watched as he searched, digging corner to corner with nerves rising in his face as he spent longer feeling for it. Anticipation rose in you; left to think about what it could be.

“Ah” he spoke out, “found it”

He pulled his hand out of the bag and revealed a small velvet bag in his hand. You inspected it on the surface, the velvet a vibrant blue that shone even in the harsh fluorescent lighting of the airport.

“What is it?” You asked.

Taehyung held the bag out for you with a smile, “here, open it.”

He placed the soft bag in your hands. It had a weight to it that you weren’t expecting. The item was a bit larger than it seemed could fit in a regular jewel bag. You slowly undid the small knot in the strings and pulled, pouring the contents into your open hand.

Inside the bag contained two ceramic ivory birds. Both identical yet beautiful with unique hand painted details covering the etched porcelain.

“Oh Tae” you said, bringing the birds up to inspect them closer, “they’re beautiful”

“Do you know what they are?”

You raised an eyebrow slightly, looking at them closer. Was this a trick question?

“They’re Christmas ornaments” you told him plainly. He gave a short, soft laugh at your tone.

“Yes but,” he started. He lifted one of the birds from your hand and held it up. The shine of the finish reflected the sunlight leaking in from the large building windows. It’s wings spread out like it may actually fly away right then and there.

“They’re turtle doves”

“Two turtle doves...like the song?”

“Yes, but it’s more than that” he gripped the dove into his hand tightly, “it means as long as I have one and you have the other, then we will be with each other forever”

You looked back down at the bird in your hand, those tears filling your eyes again and butterflies filling your stomach.

“I love it, thank you” you said quietly.

“I love you. I promise you with this turtle dove that I will always come back to you” Tae said as he held the dove to his heart.

You smiled down at the gift, it giving you a sense of peace and filling you with warmth. Long distance was hard, but these were the times that everyone said made it worth it. With this now you had a piece of Taehyung to hold onto and fill the void that was left in his absence. And that was enough for now until you could hold him in your arms again."

Jin doesn't care, maknaes seem to be infatuated with him and hobi, they puppy pile over them two all the time, well even namjoon and yoongi enjoy 2seok company in their own way.

But But Buttery But

Jeon jungkook aka Jk aka pain in his ass,
His love language was playing fighting with Jin, he used to cuddle with Hobi more. 😏

(I never minded , I just noticed, why are you pointing at ME as if it was jealousy, HAHAHA Kim Seok Jin is never jealous. AUTHOR shutup! write your story.)

Jk seems to be to touchy, well he was touchy always but now he cuddles alot, like a lot. He would hug Jin unnecessarily, telling he is cold,
Sometimes just hug out of no where, no cameras in sight but there would be Jk snaking arms around Jin.

(J: AUTHOR don't you think Jk's arms should have poetry written about them,
A: Jin-shi please write we would appreciate it.
J: please you know I can't possibly explain.
A: well the world will never understand, how sexy JK's arm around your shoulders are, you uploaded a pic with him shirtless, people will die of hottness if you both were shirtless.
THOSE WORLD WIDE SHOULDERS
THOSE TATTOOED MUSCLES ARMS)

Well Jk seem to hug Jin alot lately, Ok Jin can handle hugs, hugs are nice.

But problem starts when Jk randomly started kissing him , like those po po. What the hell are they about.
When it happened the first time, Jin was in his room practicing piano, He didn't know when Jk came, Jin just know he was practicing a piece with his eyes closed ,brow furrowed.
And as soon as the piece ended there was kiss on his forehead. Then a ""You were great Hyung, Good night"".

And He was gone ,Just like that.

Jin tries to tell himself that maybe it was a prank or something.

(Jk: AUTHORrrrŕr
A: yes jungkook-shi
Jk: hyung is stupid sometimes
A: people build walls like these to save themselves from hurting, falling in love is no easy business Jungkook-shi, these walls are meant to be broken, just you need someone willing to do it for you.
Jk: I can break all walls for him.
A: I surly believe you can, you are our golden maknae 💜. )

One time it happened in Japan , they were practicing this time and suddenly Jk goes ,pulls him for a po po. They play around practicing so Jin wasn't that shocked, he was going for a hug anyway.

Then another time while filming, jin was sitting on sofa, his pants were not covering his calves properly, jk was on ground and jin asked him to pull the pants and cover his legs then suddenly he kissed jin's calf, that too on camera. Jin complained to hobi. Anyway hobi is the root cause of all this , only hobi has conditioned these 3 maknaes into kiss giving machines. He is the one who started giving his sweet popos to all 3.

H: hyung all 3 of them are my toys, you know I play around them.
J: now they kiss me
H: oh c'mon only Jk kisses you most of the time. Jimin an Tae only do it sometimes and thats because you are so cute.
J: I don't know, it's your fault.
H: how is my fault, and you like his kisses.
J: jung hoseok I will kill you, for speaking such lies.
H: you love me too much to do that hyung.(leaving)
J: true
H: you love him too (distant)
J: true.

Then it happened more times thankfully not on camera.

On set after filming when Jin is scrolling on phone.
After dance practice.
When they are practicing vocals.
In GLODEN CLOSET

A: I was just teasing, and I would never leave you alone. I am a fan forever. )

In GOLDEN CLOSET when jk is producing or working on music.

Sometimes people are around, sometimes it's just members. In GC they were alone. Jk had just completed a melody he was stuck on for two days, jin was next to him standing and jk closed the gap between their lips, it was chaste kiss.

It left both of them shocked.
JK flees.
Leaving a dumbfounded Seokjin alone in Golden closet.

(A: Jungkook-shi don't panic, calm down please.
JK: Author i didn't mean to kiss on lip, no i mean i wanted to but not like this, aahhh you know what i mean.
A: Jungkook-shi you can't hide love, even if you want. And you are not meant to hide , You and our Lovely Seokjin-shi deserve happily ever after. You are one of the best people I know.
JK: But hyung hates me now.
A: Its literally impossible for Kim Seokjin to hate Jeon Jungkook, He can give you his most prized possession if you ever asked.
Jk: So he won't hate me because I kissed him like that.
A: well you will have to work hard for it. He is not a easy man.
JK:are you sure.
A:You Love him, It might take time but i am sure He will never hate you. Just go for him, you have my blessings)

2. Chapter 2

Jin now has started using yoongi as shield, as none of the maknae disturb him , when he is with yoongi.

Yoongi: hyung I am fine now, you should really spend time with others.
J: Yoongichi you hurt hyung, you don't want to spend time with your only hyung.
Y: Hyung I always like your company, its just I am getting complains, that we both are monopolizing each other. You know how maknaes are, they like to play with you.
J: yoongi hyung is old now, those brats are pain. I can't keep up with them.
Y: I know you are lying, you are avoiding Jk , I can see right through this bullshit.
J: because he tires me the most.
Y: Keep telling yourself lies.
J: you speak as if you know more about it than me.
Y: observing humans is my hobby hyung. And you are my favorite subject now a days. Hyung you can't keep running.
J: we 7 can't run from each other, give hyung some time.
Y: I am always here when you need me. Now please send hobi I am low on my hope vitamin, and if you see jimin tell him I am free at 7.
J: you are too much in demand.
Y: happens when you are missing for few days.

I’m trying not to move. I wouldn’t dare. I can’t even turn to look at him. I can feel more than hear Yoongi breathe as he’s pressed against my side.

I love him don’t I. And suddenly I really couldn’t breathe. My heartbeat felt like it filled the room. It’s just my thoughts and the sounds of his breathing. The room is to dark to make out anything.

He moved away from me at some point during the night. The sunlight is coming in though the window. The feeling is still there. It’s quite and the room is full of color. It’s warm. And he’s there. Nothings changed. Was the feeling always there? He looks The same. The same eyebrows. The same pouty lips. The same nose. He’s handsome. I’ve thought that for a while now. Sneaking photos when he’s fallen asleep randomly. In the car. Out in the grass under a tree while filming. Curled up on a couch in a waiting area where anyone could see him. Just sitting with his eyes closed. On my shoulder on the rare occasion.

I have to keep this quiet. I can’t say anything. There is no point. He doesn’t like men. He doesn’t like me

If you don’t I’ll kiss you

Run my hand down his jaw. Silence.There’s no cameras. The other members aren’t there to laugh. He’s not laughing.

“Sorry,

“There’s something going on.” No there isn’t . I’ve always done this.

Holding his face in my hands. Screaming my love from him from across the room so everyone could hear. Just so that I could see him smile shyly. Pushing at his buttons. Hugging him. And he’s played along sometimes. He sat across my lap while I sat on a couch while Jimin Snapped a billion photos and everyone laughed. Pulling on his hair.

“Just look. Give me a moment. I- my heads just all over the place. I’ll tell you just give me time. I’m going to talk to Jimin he- he helps me think. Just give me some time okay.”

“Yoongi asked me if you talked to me already.”
“What?”
“Idk it’s was werid he looked stressed out Tae”
Why did he ask him that. It’s only been a day.
“What’s going on”
“Don’t get mad”
“Tae”
“I just- I wasn’t trying to keep it a secret. You know how I am. I try to pretend things don’t exist.”
“Tae.”
“I think I like Yoongi.”
…
“Since when?”
“I don’t know. Idk when it started but remember when we all slept in the living room?”
“Tae that was 5 months ago! Why didn’t you say anything?”
“I just didn’t wanna ruin anything. We can’t date men. You already know how the company would react to any of us coming out. How the fans would react. And He doesn’t even like me. He said it remember? That he likes men but we don’t have to worry because he doesn't like us? And I didn’t tell you because well you live with him too. I didn’t want to put you in the middle”
“Then why are you saying something now?”
“He asked me what’s going on.”
“Okay but why are you telling me?”
“I panicked. I was just going to keep quite about it and then he just asked me out front. I knew we were gonna hang out today so I wanted to talk to you. I just needed to make sure I didn’t do anything stupid.

“What are you gonna do?”
“I could just tell him? He said he already had an idea of what’s going on. I know he doesn’t like me and we can’t date anyways. He won’t be angry or anything right?”

“How did he even find out?”
“I don’t know Jimin. I thought I was hiding it well. It’s just that we’ve been spending more time alone because of that song. We didn’t really spend time alone together. It was always with you guys around. And namjoon made that awkward joke about how it looked like Yoongi was my boyfriend because he was always holding my hand.”

“Jimin don’t be upset”
“I’m just hurt. I thought you knew you could tell me anything. You always do this. Keeping things to yourself. I can’t tell how you’re feeling half the time.”

“I like you” there I said it. Fuck.
“I want to try.”
“What?”
“I want to try dating”
“But I thought you didn’t like me?”
“I just never thought of it. I don’t hate the idea. I wanna try.”
I cover my face with my hands and I can feel my face turn red.

“We can keep it a secret.”
“I can’t. Yoongi we can’t.

“Why did you tell me then?!? You could have just lied to me! You could have just told me you were feeling tired! Anything else!”
“I didn’t want to lie to you! I was going to keep quiet about it!”

“Dance with me.”

This is the end. It’s the last time. I have to smile. I can’t ruin this. We have to go back. I can’t lose him. Why is he being so stiff. Why did you ask to dance if you didn’t want to. Stop standing so far away.
“Stop Standing so far!” I said as I smiled. Playful playful. I have to be. I pull him closer.
His face breaks.
“I can’t do this” and he runs. He pulls away and he goes out to the balcony.
“What happened?” Jimin mouths. He looks confused. I shrug. And I follow Yoongi out.
“Why did you pull me in closer” The air is cold. The city lights look beautiful as he leans again the wall.
“I thought you wanted to dance”
“I did Taehyung. I did but it hurts. I was trying to keep us apart. And then you just pulled me in. Why did you do that!”
“Because you were being weird. Who even dances like that?!?”

I hate this. This was supposed to be the last time. We had ignored this. It wasn’t going to work. It wasn’t. One last dance. Our only dance. There wasn’t anything there in the first place why does he have to look like that? Why does he have to look like I slapped him across the face. I don’t want this happening either.

Author's Note:

Yea um tae and Suga fit our personalities a lot. Like just switch out anything on set to happening at school. Also switch the disapproving company and fans to my religious parents.

It was a shit show honestly. I don’t think I’m over it. It’s been 4 years now. We’re still friends."

There is undeniably something wrong with Hoseok when Namjoon steps into the apartment.

Hoseok is leaning back on the couch, dressed in one of his husband’s jumpers and a pair of joggers. His arms are loosely circled around his middle while his feet are propped up on the coffee table.

Mei-suk is napping peacefully in her bassinet that’s barely an arms length away from where Hoseok is resting, so that doesn’t concern Namjoon.

No, what concerns him is blush on Hoseok's cheeks and the tears that are steadily spilling over his face.

“Hoseok,” he says, quiet as he lets his work bag fall to the ground near the coat rack, moving to the couch, “what’s wrong?”

The older man’s eyes widen and he sniffs, but he doesn’t rid himself of any evidence that he’s been crying. He merely lets his eyes linger on Namjoon, who is growing increasingly nervous as Hoseok stays silent.

Namjoon frowns as he approaches the couch, clearly aware that Hoseok is trying hold it together. He’s more delicate than ever these days.

Namjoon hates seeing him so obviously upset, crying and trying to hide his feelings, he can’t imagine what’s happened to make him so upset. Hoseok looks so small and frail, and Namjoon doesn’t like that at all, it makes an odd feeling settle in his stomach.

“Hoseok, baby,” he tries again, his hands moving to gently touch the other man’s face so he knows his husband is real, that he isn’t in his head.

Hoseok flinches and whines, but that doesn’t discourage Namjoon.

Something had to have happened to make him break.

“Tell me what happened.”

Hoseok sniffs and shakes his head slowly, his eyes moving to focus on the bassinet near the couch. Eyes wet and fearful and confused.

Namjoon takes his chin in his hand and forces Hoseok to face him, dark hair spilling over his sad eyes. He looks so hollow, cheeks sunken and face pale. It scares Namjoon.

“Tell me.”

It’s like watching a slow motion film. Hoseok’s face goes from scared and blushing to anguished and wrecked in a matter of seconds, and he can’t stop the cry that rips out of his mouth.

Out of instinct, Namjoon wraps his arms around him, pulling him flush to his body, and Hoseok lets his husband move him to his lap. Hoseok just cries openly as his hands grasp for any sort of purchase against the others work clothes, fingers sliding over his button up, gripping at his coat, anything to hold on to.

Namjoon shushes him, partly because his heart can’t stand the sound, and also because he doesn’t want Mei-suk waking up from her nap right now.

He strokes over Hoseok’s disheveled hair, keeping his movements slow and steady.

It takes him a few moments, but once Hoseok’s sobbing has subsided and the tears aren’t coming hot and heavy down his face, he hiccups. He’s still shaking and his eyes are bouncing around the room, but he doesn’t seem as skittish.

“They… ,” Hoseok croaks, “… they want my baby.”

Namjoon blinks. “Who?”

Hoseok swallows deeply. “The doctors. At the hospital. They want Mei-suk.”

That makes Namjoon deflate.

There’s no real threat in their tiny apartment, nothing to harm any of them. Whatever panic and fear Hoseok is experiencing is purely mental, nonetheless terrible.

He’s had this thing for a while now. Something about doctors trying to take Mei-suk.

Which, Namjoon understands where he got the idea. Her heart dropped when she was just a few minutes old and she was taken from them, right out of Hoseok’s fragile arms.

It took Namjoon and three male nurses to keep Hoseok from chasing the medical team that took Mei-suk.

It came down to a combination of Hoseok not being on his needed medication for almost a year and his hormones going everywhere due to delivering their daughter.

Namjoon sighs and cups Hoseok’s face with one hand. He has to be gentle with this.

“Hoseok,” he starts, steady and sweet and soft, “no one is going to take her.”

Hoseok shakes his head and pushes away from his husbands chest. “They took her once. Y-you were there, Namjoon, they took–“

“Her heart dropped,” Namjoon interrupts him. “She was going to die, baby. They had to take her to make her better.”

That doesn’t seem viable to Hoseok. He starts pushing harder at Namjoon’s chest and squirming in his lap, fighting to get away.

Namjoon doesn’t let go. He holds his husband to his lap despite the fighting back because there is no telling what Hoseok will do if he’s let go. He could hurt himself or their daughter.

Hoseok whines. “Let me go.”

“No.”

“Let me go,” he says again, louder this time. “You don’t believe me. No one b-believes me!”

A part of Namjoon just wants to let go of Hoseok and let him throw his fit. It might be better to just let him do as he wants. It’s going to come out sooner or later.

And, Namjoon is tired. He works hours upon hours, slaving over some half assed articles and pieces just to make ends meet. He comes home to his mentally unstable husband and their newborn daughter, never knowing what he’s coming home to.

He feels a little unstable himself, truth be told. And now, after this meltdown, he’ll need someone to stay with Hoseok and the baby because he isn’t sure Hoseok can be trusted alone with her.

A high whine makes Hoseok still in Namjoon’s arms, and then Mei-suk is crying in her bassinet. It obviously caught the older man’s attention enough for him to calm, even for a moment.

Namjoon takes his chance.

“She’s right there,” he says, adjusting his hold on his husband to point at the bassinet, “Mei-suk is right there.”

It stirs Hoseok to action, hesitantly leaving Namjoon’s lap and approaching the baby. Wringing his hands the whole way and shaking as the tears well back up at the sight of their baby daughter crying out for them.

Hoseok picks up Mei-suk as she starts screaming, her precious face screwed up and red. She lets Hoseok settle her in his arms, looking down at her with an equally sad expression.

Namjoon, defeated and tired and at the end of his rope, just watches as his husband cradles their daughter.

Hoseok sniffs and kisses her flushed face, mutters, “I’m sorry,” repeatedly.

Mei-suk coughs and continues to cry softly, her little hands batting against Hoseok’s face in the act. It makes both parents heart clench, hearing their sweet angel in distress.

Namjoon stands and joins them, wrapping Hoseok and Mei-suk in his arms. Hoseok deflates instantly and begins to cry harder, almost in tune with the baby. He holds them tighter, both halves of his heart right there in his arms.

He doesn’t know where to go from here, but he kisses Hoseok’s forehead and then Mei-suk’s soft hair, whispering, “I’m not going to let anything happen to you.”

He hopes that will be enough until he can figure out what to do.

“Jimin, baby, it’s time to wake up~” Yoongi caressed the boy’s chubby cheek with the back of a bent finger. “Wake up, my little one.”

Jimin squirmed in his crib, half batting away the invading hand, and half pushing his sleep marked face into it. Sunlight crept through his blinds and forced his body to come to terms with being awake. “Daddy,” Jimin whined to the older, clinging onto the hand trying to pull him from sleep. “‘M sleeby.”

“I know, baby. But, you have to eat breakfast now. I made chocolate chip pancakes.”

“Really?” He cracked open a single eye to peer up at Yoongi with hope. “For Minnie?”

“Yes,” Yoongi cooed, “for my precious Minnie. But only good boys get pancakes, so you have to wake up.”

“Mmmmm, but ‘m cozy…I eat in my crib? P’ease, daddy?”

Yoongi laughed quietly, “no, baby. C’mere and Daddy will get you cleaned up and changed.” He scooped the younger up out of his crib and carried him to the changing station. It was Saturday, their only full day off in weeks, meaning that it was their first time to settle into their roles completely. “What do you wanna wear today?”

“Hmm, daddy’s sweatshirt?”

“I was thinking more along the lines of things in your closet, little one.” Yoongi reminded him gently while collecting a fresh diaper and baby wipes from the storage unit.

“But, comfy.” Jimin jutted his bottom lip out, pulling his best puppy-dog eyes on the older.

“You have plenty of clothes, Jiminie-legs up, please.” He tugged off Jimin’s cowboy themed pj pants and then the wet diaper. He wrapped it up and tossed it into the waste bin near his feet. “Good Boy,” he praised the younger. Yoongi quickly wiped down Jimin’s crotch while he was distracted with picking out today’s outfit. He worked as fast as he could before a fuss could be kicked up and everything became twice as hard. Jimin was notorious for complaining and crying during diaper changes.

“Daddy?”

“Hmm?”

“Paci? Please?”

Yoongi smiled at his baby’s manners despite the sleep still very evident. “Sure, baby. Hold on.” He made his way back to the crib and scooped up Jimin’s beloved pacified that had fallen out of the boy’s mouth sometime during the night. “Here it is~”

“Tank you.” Jimin snatched the paci out of Yoongi’s hands with a bit too much force and popped the rubber piece into his mouth. The quiet sounds of suckling reached Yoongi’s ears.

“You’re welcome, my sweet boy. Now, do I have to pick your outfit out today?”

Jimin squirmed around on the table, but inevitably nodded his head at Yoongi. Yoongi sighed, but went to the closet full of colorful patterned clothes and odd assortment of onesies and dresses alike.

“Hmm, how about this?” Yoongi pulled out a bright yellow knit sweater with a big duck printed on the front and a pair of soft leggings that said ‘QUACK’ on the leg.

Jimin clapped his hands together, “yes! Duckies!”

“Okay, my little duck, I think we have a winner.” Yoongi gently tickled Jimin’s exposed stomach with his nose, peppering small kisses to the soft skin, and was rewarded with the endless giggles he loved so much. “Sit up, please.”

Yoongi tugged the oversized sweater over the younger’s head, “boop! There’s my favorite boy!” Jimin squealed happily, giggled muffled by his pacifier. Yoongi booped Jimin’s nose with his own before helping him down off the station. “Alright, you remember one leg and then the next. Don’t do two at the same time, my silly boy.”

“O’tay, Daddy.” Jimin’s tiny fists gripped Yoongi’s shirt for stabilization as there had been many incidents where the ground acquainted itself with Jimin. “One foot,” Jimin reminded himself and Yoongi guided one of his legs up in the air, “two foot.”

Yoongi smiled at the antics. “Good job, Baby!”

“T’anks,” Jimin snuggled into his daddy’s chest. He loved his ducky shirt-it was his favorite after all. Soft and yellow and fuzzy and his favorite animal! Ducks! That’s what his daddy called him: his little duck. “Love you, daddy.”

Yoongi smile widened even more. While his persona was often cold and admittedly a bit harsh, Jimin effortlessly cracked him open with those silly high-pitched giggles and sweater paws. It took years for them to get together, months before they finally mustered up the courage to talk about their private lives like that, but somehow they made it work. And now Yoongi had a perfect little boy to look after and adore with his entire heart.

“I love you more, my pretty duckling.” Yoongi brushed his thumb against the light blush on Jimin’s cheek, tracing the colors of his emotions adoringly. “Shall we eat breakfast now, baby?”

“Mhm! P’ease-“ Jimin gasped and dashed over to his crib, “Wait!” His little hands clung to the wooden rails as he peered into his sleeping space. “Forgot Mr. Snuggles! Can you get ‘im? P’ease?” Jimin could have easily gotten it himself, nearly the same height at Yoongi, but obviously only his daddy knew how to lower the side of the crib and scoop up his beloved stuffed animal.

“How silly of me. Cant believe we almost forgot Mr. Snuggles. Such a smart big for remembering.” Yoongi easily collected the animal off from the mattress, handing it down to Jimin. “There we go.”

Jimin squeezed the plush toy to his chest protectively. Mr. Snuggles was the first gift Yoongi ever got him after their relationship morphed into the one it was now. It was a baby blue elephant, with worn out ears from incessant chewing, and stubby little legs like Jimin’s.

“Okay, breakfast time, baby boy.” Yoongi offered his hand out to the younger who easily snatched it up greedily. They made their way to the kitchen (that smelled heavenly if you asked Jimin). A little transparent plastic plate with dividers so Jimin’s food wouldn’t touch each other was piled full of cut up strips of pancakes and sweet maple syrup. “Up ya go.” Yoongi plopped the younger into his high chair, snapping the buckles, and sliding in the tray.

Jimin rapped his hands against the white plastic in anticipation. Being in his high chair always meant good things. Although it du mean that Mr. Snuggles had to stay down on the table so he didn’t get dirty.

“Pancakes for you aaaand pancakes for daddy.”

Yoongi would kill a man just to see Jimin smile the way he did during moments like these; eyes crinkled into crescent moons and lips stretching across his cheeks. No matter how secretive they had to be or how many people would judge them for their lifestyle, Yoongi wouldn’t give it up for anything."

The story starts with an end.

“I can't do this anymore,” Taehyung says, and the memory of it will haunt Jungkook for months.

Every little detail is etched on his mind like a stubborn stain. From the way Taehyung avoids his eyes to the state of Taehyung’s bedroom.

There's a misplaced pillow on the floor, an unmade bed by the window, a tipped-over perfume bottle on the vanity, and a string of polaroids pinned to the corkboard. Like one of those Frances Glessner Lee dollhouses but without any bloodstain on the walls. And Jungkook will study the diorama over and over again just to find a clue, an answer.

If he was a little less scared, he’d ask for all the answers from the person standing right in front of him.

But he’s terrified, so he says, “Okay.”

And he leaves.

⋆⋆⋆ ☾ ⋆⋆⋆

Although the breakup hurts, the world keeps spinning. In three days, Jungkook’s short break will end and he’ll have to fly back to Russia to continue his astronaut training. In three days, he’ll have to put up a front and pretend everything’s fine. He can't afford to be weak in front of the other candidates, not when he’s so close to the finishing line.

It has always been Jungkook’s dream to travel to space. When he was younger, his dad used to buy him those hard-covered books with pictures of celestial bodies inside and Jungkook would spend his afternoons flipping through the pages, marvelling at the colourful interstellar clouds. For years, the dream remained as just that — an innocent childhood dream.

Until he turned 26 and the government announced the second Korean Astronaut Program. Jungkook had been hesitant to apply, but Taehyung had believed in him right from the start. Sweet, kind Taehyung who knew that all Jungkook needed was a little push, someone to silence his doubts.

(“I don’t know, hyung. I mean, there's a fat chance I’ll get it. A lot of people will be applying for it, people smarter and more fitting for the program than I am.”

“Baby, just by applying, you'd increase your chance of getting accepted by 50%.”

“But-”

“Have you forgotten about the time you served in the Air Force division during your military service?”

“...”

“Jungkook, you flew fighter jets for two years, had the longest flight hours and was awarded best pilot out of hundreds others. If anyone deserves a spot in the program, it's you.”)

It took days of perfecting his résumé before Jungkook had felt satisfied enough to submit his application. On the day the results came out, Taehyung had stayed by his side, giving him occasional touches here and there just to ground him.

(“I can’t do it,” Jungkook says, hands shaking from nerves. He leans back on the couch and closes his eyes.

“Do you want me to read it for you?”

“No! Don’t open it yet!”

“Too late,” Taehyung says, and Jungkook jolts forward, eyes opened wide only to see a shit eating grin on Taehyung’s face and his laptop sitting untouched on the table.

“Hyung! You almost gave me a heart attack.”

Taehyung has the audacity to laugh at him but he stops when Jungkook starts to sulk.

“Come ooonnn baby, just open it.”

“What if I don't get it?”

“Then we’ll cook twelve cups of ramen and eat until our stomachs feel like bursting. After that we’ll go to sleep and call in sick tomorrow and do absolutely nothing the whole day.”

Jungkook bites on his lower lip.

“But what if I get it?”

“Then we’ll celebrate!!!! We’ll book a trip to... Bali! Imagine, Jungkook. It’ll be just you and me, walking down the beach, enjoying the cool breeze, kissing under the stars, making lo—”

“Okay,” Jungkook says, newly invigorated. He smashes the touchpad and forces his eyes to stay open.

“What does it say?” Taehyung whispers beside him, leaning forward to see the screen better. The room is silent as they read the email with bated breath. Then—

“Fuck.”

Jungkook stares at the screen, incredulous.

There, typed in black ink, is a short paragraph congratulating him for being accepted into the program.

He feels Taehyung's hands cupping his cheeks, pulling him until they're facing each other. Taehyung smiles at him, wide and happy.

“Told you you’d make it.”

Jungkook doesn't know what he's feeling at that moment. There are too many emotions swimming in his system. Joy, disbelief, anxiety, but mostly confusion.

“Hyung, I’m going to space.”

Taehyung leans in and presses their foreheads together. The air turns somber when the reality of the situation hits them. In a month, Jungkook will leave for training and they won't be able to see each other for the next year and a half.

“Promise you won't forget me when you're up there,” Taehyung whispers and Jungkook has to hold himself back from crying.

He closes his eyes and basks in Taehyung’s warmth. He’ll miss this.

“I won’t.”)

It’s a miracle really. Because out of thousands of applicants, Jungkook had been chosen as one of six candidates. The other five are Kim Namjoon, a mathematician from KAIST, Shin Ryujin, an aerospace engineer from KARI, Seo Soojin, a veterinarian from Gwangju, Bae Joohyun, a neurosurgeon from Seoul, and Min Yoongi, a psychologist from SNU.

Meeting new people had never been Jungkook’s forte — he would turn into a shy, stuttering mess in front of strangers. Especially if they're intimidating. Taehyung, knowing this, had accompanied him to the program briefing, and he’d held Jungkook’s hand throughout, serving as an anchor for Jungkook while he introduced himself to the other candidates.

When the time came for Jungkook to finally leave for Russia, Taehyung had driven him to the airport. And they’d spent what little time they had left just meandering the stores with Taehyung plastered to Jungkook’s side.

(“Is the coffee too bitter?”

“Hmm?”

“You haven't had a single sip since we sat down.”

Taehyung looks around the cafe before reaching out to hold Jungkook’s hand. Jungkook doesn't ask if he’s okay because he’s clearly not. At times like this, no words can ease the pain.

“I love you, Jungkook. I really do,” Taehyung says with a shaky voice. He brings Jungkook’s hand to his lips and lets it rest there. “So much.”

In an ideal world, Jungkook would lean over the table to kiss him. But he can’t, because the world they live in is unfair and mean to people like them. So he settles for tracing Taehyung’s lips with his thumb, heart hurting in the worst way possible.

“I love you too, hyung.” He can feel tears welling up in his eyes, the corners of his lips quivering. “Please wait for me.”

“I’ll always be waiting for you, Jungkook-ah.”)

Taehyung had been beside him since the beginning of the journey. It literally breaks Jungkook to know that he won’t be there at the end of it.

POSTED ON MY TUMBLR TOO @/YUNKIVERSAL

NAMJOON X FEM!READER

It was a rainy day when I woke up, yet despite it being so dull, it brought me joy. To see the different shades of grey in the sky, with small tinges of blue. The clouds darkened compared to a sunny day.
The way the rain drops raced each other down the window of my apartment, overlooking the bustling city filled with potholes full of water.
The cement a darker colour than usual, looking slippery and somewhat dangerous to walk upon.
It seemed like a perfect day to me.
A perfect day to go to my favourite coffee shop and read for hours upon end with no worries or thoughts to be seen for miles.

-‐-------------------------------------------------------

Arriving at Mins Café was a journey and a half. I got soaked from a car that was going way over the legal speed limit, which in result caused everything on me to get soaked aswell, including my books. Oh my precious books.
They wouldn't dry out for a few hours, maybe they wouldn't dry out at all and would rather crumble and rip in my hands.
So I decided to make my way to the art museum instead, it wasn't far from the café anyway.
After ordering my regular black Americano, I found myself lost in thought whilst taking a slow stroll to the museum, so lost in thought I completely missed the cyclist who I nearly knocked off their bike.
'Oh my gosh.. I am so terribly sorry.' My voice was high and shaking, christ I must have given the cyclist a fright after nearly knocking him over. But then again, who would even think of cycling in weather like this?
'It's no problem at all. I'm sorry I didn't warn you I was coming' he looked at me sheepishly as he spoke 'My bell is broken and I forgot to replace it.'
'No its okay, you should really get that bell fixed though, just to be safe' a warm smile spread across my face as I spoke to this stranger infront of me.
'I-I really should.. uh it was nice meeting you, I'm sorry again.' he stuttered over his own words before taking off on his bicycle yet again.

----------------------------------------------------

Ah, what a joy to finally be in the art museum again.
I used to spend a majority of my time here, but after covid hit I couldn't visit as much as I'd like.
Wandering around and I was so entranced by the beautiful artwork that adorned this place.
So many different stories told in so many different ways, each personal to the artist who had painted or designed it.
I was staring at a piece that I had found to be simply magnificent titled 'The sky holds its stars for you' by Kim Taehyung.
He had always been my favourite artist, I could never bore myself of looking at his work, but this one.. this one was new and it held a beauty nothing could compare to.
'Oh I am so sorry, I didn't mean to bump into you I was just-' a familiar voice rambled on as my coffee spilt slightly on my knitted sweater.
'It's okay' I smiled lightly as I looked up into the eyes of the bicycle guy.
'Gosh I got coffee all over you, I am so sor-'
'Hey.. its okay, I promise. You don't need to keep apologising' I giggled as he continuously apologised to me.
'Can.. can I buy you another one? A way to say sorry without verbally saying it again.' He mumbled, yet I still managed to catch what he was saying, as he rubbed the back of his neck in embarrassment.
'Sure, I'd like that.'

-----------------------------------------------------------

'Namjoon.'
'Huh?'
'My name.. its Namjoon' He smiled at me.
'Y/N' I simply stated whilst smiling back at him.
We arrived at Mins Café, again for me, and he had ushered me into my seat whilst asking what I wanted before taking off to get our drinks.
I shrugged my coat off my shoulders and placed it on the seat next to me.

We spoke for hours, getting to know every little thing about each other. Our jobs, our hobbies, what we do in our free time, our families.
It was like we had been best friends for years, and we could be ourselves around each other without the fear of any judgement.
'It's getting late.. I should get back home, my cat needs feeding' I said lowly with a slight frown, never wanting this moment to end.
'I can walk you home.' Namjoon said and then quickly slammed his hand on his face.
'I just.. um I mean, if you wanted me to. Its late out and I don't want any creepy people to follow you or you know do something bad or-'
He went on a tangent again, his cheeks staining pink.
'I'd like that, alot Joon.' His cheeks turning an even darker pink, almost red, as I called him by his nickname.

------------------------------------------------------------

I had arrived home safely with the escort of Namjoon by my side. He was adamant on getting me home as quick as possible as the temperature was dropping and he didn't want me to become sick as my coat was still sopping wet from the car incident earlier on in the day.
'Thank you, Joon. For today. Its been so lovely getting to know you.. I really hope we can do it again some time.' Now it was my turn to start blushing as I placed my head down, not daring to look into his beautiful eyes.
He lifted my chin up to look at him.
'Me too Y/N/N..' he started before continuing with 'Can.. can I kiss you? I know we only just met earlier today but I feel such a connection and I just-'
'Yes Joon, you can'
He placed his lips on mine so delicately it felt like a feather tickling at them.
I gripped the back of his neck softly, pulling him closer and he put more passion into the kiss and I returned it, the only thing breaking us apart was the need for oxygen.
'That was.. wow' He started.
'Wow indeed.' I whispered as I put my head down again, my heart racing feverishly againt my chest.
He gave me one last peck before stepping away from the door slightly, beginning to walk off but not before turning to say one last thing.
'Y/N, the sky holds its stars for you..'"

“No, no, no—” Taehyung swore loudly, tossing his controller onto the bed and crossing his arms over his chest. Namjoon laughed, his grin bright enough that it dimpled his cheek.

“You lose.”

“Come on,” Taehyung whined. “Give me one more chance. Me and Jungkook are technically tied.”

Namjoon hesitated, looking at Jungkook, who pouted. “Hey, I won fair and square.”

“And you lost once against me,” Taehyung whined.

“Honestly, the longer we argue over who is going to clean up, the messier things are going to get,” Namjoon said.

“One more game,” Taehyung pleaded. “It’s only fair.”

Jungkook groaned. “Fine. One more.”

He took the controller from Namjoon and took switched spots with him, settling onto the bed next to Taehyung.

“You know, you might have been smarter just to suggest you and me split the chores,” Jungkook said as they started another round. “That way there wouldn’t have been a chance of you losing completely.”

“Yeah, but if I beat you I don’t have to do any cleaning. Jimin and Hobi-hyung were out drinking last night,” Taehyung argued, his eyes wide as he focused on the screen. “I’m not cleaning up that mess.”

“It can’t be that bad,” Namjoon argued. He rose, sinking down to crawl under the screen’s view so he wouldn’t interrupt the two playing. He cracked open the door, sticking his head out.

“Oof,” he grunted, making a whistling noise as he sucked in through his teeth.

“That bad?” Taehyung worried. He swore softly when Jungkook’s character took the lead.

“Oh it’s… Bad,” Namjoon said. He crawled onto the bed carefully behind them. “I pity whoever loses this match.”

“It’s going to be Taehyungie-hyung,” Jungkook teased, his nose crinkling up as his thumbs pounded at the controller.

“It’s going to be Jungkook,” Taehyung responded, his teeth bared and gritted.

The two kept neck and neck as the game progressed, damage mounting for each player’s character.

Taehyung could feel his heart squeezing into his throat as the final seconds of the round clicked down and Jungkook’s points kept ticking upward. When the deep red ‘Game Over’ filled the screen, paired with a very definite ‘You are dead’ on Taehyung’s side, he swore. He looked around the room, desperate for something to blame for his loss. When he found nothing, he dropped the controller on the bed and pouted, slumping back against the headboard.

“You have an advantage,” he sulked.

“Oh? Is that so?” Jungkook asked, his mouth curling up into a smile despite Taehyung’s mood.

“You know this game better.”

“We’ve played it literally the same amount of times. If anything you and me had an advantage over Joon-hyung, who beat us both pretty squarely.”

“Beginner’s luck,” Namjoon said, shrugged. He clapped Taehyung on the knee. “Whelp. Best get to cleaning. It needs to be done before Jin-hyung comes home or he’s gonna have all of our balls as trophies.”

“Why’d you promise him we’d clean anyways?” Taehyung whined, pulling his knee out of Namjoon’s grip.

“Because he’s cleaned for us these past few weeks. He’s had a rough time lately, it’s the least we can do.”

Taehyung rolled his eyes deeply. He knew Namjoon was right, but it still sucked to lose. “Then why don’t you clean for him?”

Namjoon grinned. “I offered. “You suggested a game. The punishment always goes to the one that suggests it, don’t you know that by now?”

Taehyung curled his lip up, wanting to say something else but knowing he shouldn’t. Sulking or not, he didn’t want to start a fight with his boyfriends. “I wish you’d died,” he mumbled instead, rising from the bed. He shuffled forward, hesitating before opening the door.

The dorm was far worse than he’d imagined. There were clothes, empty bottles, and empty food containers everywhere. It would take hours to clean on his own. Taehyung groaned dramatically, slumping against the door frame.

“This is insane,” he grumbled.

“It’s a mess,” Jungkook agreed, coming up behind him. Taehyung looked over at him, his chin wrinkled in a pout that spread his mouth downward.

“You expect me to clean this whole thing by myself?”

“You lost the game.” Jungkook shrugged. He slipped past Taehyung and wandered into the kitchen, dodging piles of clothes and containers as he did. Taehyung watched him open the fridge and pull out a container of food. He stood at the counter while he ate, scrolling through his phone.

Taehyung wandered out, picking a corner of the living room (not like any was particularly cleaner than others) and beginning to clean. He glanced up from the pile of clothes he was sorting when he heard movement in the kitchen. Jungkook had finished his food and was heading back into the bedroom.

“Hey!” Taehyung wailed, stepping in front of Jungkook’s path.

Jungkook’s bottom lip jutted out, his brows rising in confusion. “Huh?” He asked, innocent written over his features.

Taehyung glared despite the urge to kiss his boyfriend’s pretty mouth. He jutted his finger toward the kitchen.

Jungkook looked back. “What? Did you want some?”

“No,” Taehyung stressed. “The mess. You left your garbage.”

Jungkook looked back again. “Ah, I guess I did.” He smiled sheepishly at Taehyung. “Sorry about that.” He turned and headed back into the kitchen, grabbing his garbage and throwing it into the can. “There. All better,” he said as he walked back.

Taehyung glared. “I really wish you’d died,” he grumbled, grabbing a pile of wrappers and heading into the kitchen with them as Jungkook headed back into their bedroom.

It felt like he’d been cleaning for hours when Taehyung heard the door open again. He glanced back, seeing Jungkook and Namjoon step out of the room.

“Did you need something?” Taehyung grumbled, carrying clothes to a growing pile he’d created for dirty laundry.

“You’ve gotten so much done,” Jungkook said in awe. He came around, taking the clothes from Taehyung’s hands. “I’ll get the rest of the laundry and get it started.”

“It looks like you still need to sweep, I’ll do that,” Namjoon said, grabbing the nearby broom. Taehyung stood still for a moment, confusion written on his face. “Wh—""

Namjoon smiled sweetly, ignoring Taehyung’s confused expression as he set to work sweeping the mess of the dorm’s kitchen. Jungkook buzzed around him, snagging clothes and other fabric items for washing.

It took Taehyung’s brain a moment to catch up. They were helping. He smiled softly, leaning on the wall for a moment to take a breath. They’d won fair and square (despite his complaints) and they were still helping.

“Thank you,” Taehyung whispered when Namjoon passed by him. Namjoon paused and turned, smiling.

“We love you.” He kissed Taehyung gently and handed him the dustpan. “Help me sweep?”

“Of course.” Taehyung headed into the kitchen with him, pausing a moment to pull Jungkook into a deep kiss as well. Jungkook smiled brightly, his nose wrinkling.

“Still wish we’d died?” He teased.

“Never,” Taehyung whispered."

The icy breeze cuts through Jeongguk’s side as he approaches his car. It’s snowing, but it’s everything but peaceful. Snow is supposed to be joyful, but today it only brings emptiness.

Jeongguk’s hands feel like ice. He feels the wetness from the snow-drops seep into his gloves, making him shiver. He walks just a bit faster. A short walk can feel like miles in this weather.

He thinks back to the events of hours before. Sitting in his chair, office doors closed, a new beat flowing from the speakers within. It was the second day after being given the new soundtrack. Jeongguk had to prepare lyrics soon because it was an add-in at his own request. The piece was beautiful and he knew that the perfect lyrics had to accompany. However, sitting in his chair for hours and hours on end, looking at a blank Word Document, he felt his frustration grow. Everyone else had gone home for the night, and when asked if Jeongguk wanted to join, he declined with a smile.

It was around four am now, and that was when he decided to leave. The bags were ever-so-present under his eyes. Exhaustion was creeping in, he could feel it in his chilled bones.

Once he got into his vehicle, it took a few minutes for it to warm, and his spirits lifted a little. He was ready to crawl into bed when he arrived home.

Driving down the empty street, with a soft tune in the speakers, he sighed. The snow blurred the road slightly, so he drove slower.

Later on, Jeongguk arrived at his apartment, key in hand, ready for a nice sleep. He unlocked the door, pushing it open, not expecting to see a light coming from the fireplace. He welcomed the warmth of his home with open arms.

Shutting the door behind him, Jeongguk hears a loud bark as he goes to remove his shoes. Bam jumps up and greets him, licking his hand after. Jeongguk chuckles, “Hi Bam, I missed you too.”

“Jeongguk-ah, you’re finally home!” Jeongguk hears the soft voice from their couch. He sees Jimin approaching him, warmth personified. He feels Jimin’s arms bring him close in an embrace, which he returns. Jeongguk closes his eyes and basks in the warmth.

Jimin places his lips on Jeongguk’s, warm and inviting. The greatest contrast to the snow from earlier. Jeongguk, still shivering, feels himself relax into the kiss, craving warmth and love.

Jimin lets go first, going to their closet, retrieving a blanket. He places it around Jeongguk’s shoulders, “You’re freezing…” Jimin comments.

Jeongguk takes each end of the blanket, bundling himself in it, it’s extra fuzzy, his favorite. Of course, Jimin knows, and Jeongguk can’t help but feel the urge to cry.

Whether it’s in frustration or in love, he doesn’t know.

Jeongguk notices Jimin’s appearance, while much more relaxed, he carries the bags under his eyes much like Jeongguk does.

“You didn’t have to wait for me, you know…” Jeongguk mentions, concerned.

“But I did, I was worried about you, you looked very stressed. Do you want to talk about it?”

“Not right now, I really just want to sleep…” Jeongguk yawns sleepily.

“Okay, Baby,” Jimin then takes hold of his hand, leading them to their bedroom, with Bam following close behind. They settle into bed, the moonlight peaking through their closed curtains, leaving a white glow in the room.

Jeongguk lies down, closing his eyes. The softness of the bed and Jimin’s presence relax him, but he just can’t seem to fall asleep no matter what. Minutes that feel like hours pass, and he's sure he’s tried sleeping on every side three times already. He uncovers himself in frustration and heads back to the living room, sitting in front of the fire.

Why can’t I think of any lyrics? What is wrong with me? Jeongguk’s mind replays these thoughts over and over as he watches the continuous flicker of the flames.

The couch beside him sinks a little and Jeongguk feels a soft pair of lips graze against his neck, “Hey…” Jimin begins, “I know it might be hard to talk about, but I really want to help…”

Jeongguk sighs, “It’s the lyrics for the new soundtrack,” he pauses, takes a deep breath and starts again, “I’ve been revising them so many times and I feel like nothing is working,” He sees the tears start forming in his eyes, trying to blink them away, “It’s like if I can’t write these lyrics, why did I even take on this song…” He blinks again and a tear falls. It was like a dam broke, and a sob comes out, “I-I’m sorry, I-I didn’t want to” he sobs, “burden you like this…”

“No, please, don’t worry about that. I should have stayed with you earlier…” Jimin says, hugging Jeongguk, feeling tears fall on his shoulder.

“What can I do to make it better?”

“Stay with me.”

“Okay.”

-

Jeongguk and Jimin return to their bedroom, ready to sleep. They get into bed together, and Jimin wraps his arms around Jeongguk’s middle, bringing him closer. Jeongguk turns himself to face Jimin, and he brings himself closer. Their lips meet, and it’s the softest touch. Jeongguk blushes like it's the first time once again. He tucks his head between Jimin’s neck and shoulder, giving him some kisses there, before relaxing once again.

“Thank you, Jimin,” he says softly, before dozing off to sleep, “I love you.”

“I love you too,” Jimin replies and snuggles him impossibly closer.

Together, they fall asleep, their warmth shared.

-

An orange glow fills the room as the sun rises. Jeongguk wakes, and the first thing he sees is Jimin, whose lips are parted open in sleep, and it’s the most beautiful sight he’s seen.

Jeongguk leans up, and pecks Jimin’s forehead, then gets up, and goes into the living room. Opening the curtains, and seeing a cloudless morning, the stunning view of Seoul below, he smiles brightly.

He feels like a whole new person, and it’s the best he’s ever felt. Bam stands next to him, and Jeongguk pets his head, “You’re so sweet, aren’t you…” Jeongguk says, and he can’t stop smiling.

“You two are adorable,” a raspy voice says from behind them. They both turn and see Jimin standing, his hair tousled with the softest look in his eyes.

“That’s all you…” Jeongguk replies and gives him a small kiss, looking into Jimin’s eyes, smiling brightly, “Thank you so much for last night.”

“Anything for you, Love.”

-

Jeongguk has never felt more joyous."

!!! general cw for anxiety, since it’s heavily talked about !!!

Yoongi’s hunched over, prying off his rain boots with his hands while standing in the entryway of his apartment, when he sees it: a large heap of black on his bed that strangely sounds like it’s… sniffling. He freezes, hoping not to startle it (despite the raging thunderstorm outside), and gradually straightens up. He also slowly lowers the leg he’d raised in the air—to help himself remove one of his rain boots—and brings his arms down to his sides.

As Yoongi stands there, shivering from the water of his soaked rain slicker leaking through the seams along his arms and shoulders, he intently studies the heap of black. It’s clearly not human, with what appears to be a bundle of wriggling tentacles on its lower half. Its arms are wrapped around its body, like they’re physically trying to hold the heap together. And it’s curled in on itself so tightly that Yoongi can’t discern where its head or face might be, even though he’s sure it’s sitting upright.

The need to draw nearer to the heap plagues Yoongi as the motion-activated entryway light overhead shuts off. He searches for anything threatening him harm in the dark, while lightning occasionally illuminates the heap, but finds nothing. The heap of black just oozes genuine, overwhelming sadness, and that’s enough for Yoongi to discard his rain slicker and final remaining rain boot in the entryway—the overhead light flicking on again—before giving in to his urge.

Taking slow, measured steps, Yoongi treks closer. As he approaches, he notes the heap isn’t wearing any clothes and its head is obscured by a gigantic cockle shell. There’s also a salty tang in the air that reminds Yoongi of the days he spent at the beach as a kid. The cleanliness of the smell doesn’t suit the backdrop of such a tiny, now lightless apartment in the developed, urban area of Gangdong. But, Yoongi concedes, nothing about this situation makes sense anyway; not the heap of black’s appearance, his curious familiarity with the heap of black once he’s in front of it.

“It’s you,” breathes Yoongi after turning on his bedside lamp. Something akin to relief fills him when the heap shifts on the bed at the sound of his voice. “The monster living under my bed.”

When the monster lifts its head, the blue and gray teardrop-shaped gems dotting its smooth, strangely attractive face glitter in the fluorescent light. “You’re home,” it says in a surprisingly pleasant baritone, though its large eyes hold immense misery. There’s no visible mouth for Yoongi to place the sound, but maybe the source is the trio of different-sized holes at the side of the monster’s head that are nearly concealed by its cockle shell hat.

At a clamorous burst of thunder, the entire coloring of the monster ripples all of a sudden, shifting from solid black to a dark, striped pattern of blue-and-gray. While staring into Yoongi’s eyes, it says, “Welcome home, Min Yoongi.”

Yoongi’s lips pop open in surprise, both from the color change and from hearing his whole name. “Uh, thank you, m—” He swallows down the word he was going to say aloud and instead asks, “What’s your name?”

“True names have power, where I’m from,” says the monster, brushing the gems from its cheeks with the blue-and-gray stumps of its thick, tentacle-like arms. The gems tinkle as they initially land atop each other on Yoongi’s rumpled sheets, but another boom of thunder covers up the sounds of the monster scraping them into a neat pile at the foot of Yoongi’s bed.

“But you, Min Yoongi—” adds the monster after the thunder fades some and a new pattern of blue-and-gray chevrons dances across its skin. “—can call me Kim Taehyung.”

Yoongi softly repeats the name he’s permitted to call the monster and tells Taehyung just to call him “Yoongi.” Taehyung easily agrees, the monster’s skin becoming a tessellation of irregular pentagons that include a bit of green at the next thunderclap.

Yoongi wonders if he can ask why Taehyung is here, without it seeming rude. He ultimately decides he should probably build up to a question like that first. “Can I sit, Taehyung?” he inquires, gesturing to the bed.

Taehyung nods, and Yoongi sits on Taehyung’s right, opposite the small pile of gems. “Of course. This is your room. I just… visit sometimes.”

That much Yoongi knew. He always had a suspicion he had a visitor, with random snacks (usually his half-open bag of honey butter chips) disappearing—just for the bag to reappear, emptied, into his recycling later that week—and wet puddles showing up, without fail, on the floor around his bed after each recording of his latest YouTube video.

“Is there a reason you visited today?” questions Yoongi inquisitively prior to a series of nearby violent claps of thunder.

Taehyung flinches at each one. The faint green vanishes from the monster’s skin as the dark stripes of blue and gray return and grow thicker and thicker after every thundercrash, until the solid black Yoongi first saw on Taehyung is back.

“I have anxiety,” states the monster with a whisper. A ring of fuchsia climbs down Taehyung’s entire form before more cracks of thunder splotch blue and gray across the monster’s body. “And your voice is very calming, Yoongi. Very soothing.”

Yoongi nearly preens at this. He’s proud of his work, his ASMR channel. And to hear he’s helped someone—well, something—like Taehyung become less anxious makes him feel somewhat fulfilled. Like what he’s doing—softly reading all those Ikea manuals, working hard to make his abundant knowledge about European architecture and interior design understandable, and overlaying his videos with actual sounds of him constructing the furniture he reads about—is aiding those in need.

“I’m sorry, by the way,” Taehyung admits suddenly, appearing sheepish while still mutedly dotted with pink, blue, and gray.

There’s a delicate pause then; where Yoongi, now extremely confused, considers asking, “For what?” But it’s broken by the monster expounding and not by the expected noise of the departing thunderstorm outside.

“About your floors. When I get super relaxed, I, um, turn kinda sticky? And the goo runs everywhere? It’s my least favorite part of being me, but it turns out I’m never really relaxed, so I don’t have to worry about it very often.”

As thunder rolls from far off and Taehyung laughs self-deprecatingly, Yoongi frowns. He looks Taehyung over, and the kaleidoscopic monster doesn’t appear the least bit “sticky.” Yoongi’s sheets aren’t gooey either, which means Taehyung isn’t even remotely relaxed. Yoongi ponders what he can do to help Taehyung relax, since that’s what the monster came to do. What first comes to mind is reassuring the monster, and Yoongi thinks that’s a start.

“The goo wasn’t a problem, Taehyung. And neither are you for making it.”

Taehyung’s face colors, flashing a brilliant yellow, and Yoongi predicts the confusion in the monster’s tone before Taehyung protests, “But I dirtied your floors…”

Yoongi shrugs and says, “Maybe, but it was easy to take care of. And I think getting you to relax will be too.”

invisible string - taylor swift

Over the years, falling in love had been a rollercoaster of highs and lows, and twists and turns, of exhilarating free-falls and nerve-wracking creeping to the edge. It had never felt simple, and it had always kept Jungkook on the tremulous edge between angst and hope. He penned songs about his euphoria and desolation, and made a career out of his darkest pains and brightest joys.

Fame brought him opportunity attached to notoriety and censure he didn’t want or deserve. His dreams twisted into nightmares with every inked headline and digital scars that haunted his name. He felt like a walking cataclysm, unable to escape the storm that had become his life. He endured what he could and learned to walk with his head held high as words sharp as knives were flung at him by the carless and callous, and lies were weaved into the stories sewn about his life to sell at a profit.

But sometimes the strain was too much and he crumbled under the pressure. Sometimes he sought out comfort and affection from those well-practiced in pretence, and he fell into their traps, blinded by the pretty glare of their whitened teeth as they smiled while they made false promises of honesty and security.

In the end, it was always Jungkook who was the one left to suffer from exposure. Ridiculed for being so quick to give out his heart, painted the villain for wanting to feel a connection, written off as the one to blame for his failure to protect his heart from those who seduced him with cruel intentions. It was him who had his art picked apart by critics who wanted to believe his purest form of self-expression was a cry for attention and victimisation instead of the cathartic, therapeutic release that it was.

It had been a decade of taking the roads less travelled only to find they were the thorniest of all before he found the clear path he’d been looking for. A decade of lining up for rollercoaster after rollercoaster before he was taken by the hand and lead from all the thrills to a new kind of exhilaration.

A decade before he met Taehyung and saw the rest of his life in total clarity.

Taehyung walked into Jungkook’s life quietly. A friend of a friend, they met while mingling at an event while Jungkook’s arm was gripped tightly by someone who belonged in the past forevermore. He was an unknown, and in the midst of the razzle-dazzle of celebrity, he was unassuming and sincere in manner and attitude.

They did not become friends immediately, or speak for sometime after that first meeting. But he lingered in the back of Jungkook’s mind, coming to light in moments of curious wonder. It wasn’t until Jungkook was unattached and attending yet another celebrity-filled event that his presence was required at, that they met again.

Instead of attending the after-party as expected, Jungkook, Taehyung, and their small of friends and acquaintances escaped to a quiet bar in an often overlooked neighbourhood where they enjoyed food and drink, good company, and good conversation.

Life was never the same again for Jungkook after that night.

The exchange of phone numbers became texting, became calling, became video calls and secret rendezvous in the places only they knew, where they could be shielded from the probing eyes of vultures looking to pick Jungkook apart at the seams.

Taehyung was an actor, but he preferred to remain just outside the blinding light of the spotlight. He lingered on the peripheral, working for recognition within the industry and not validation from the curious but ignorant public. He kept his private life private, and after years and years of having his pain printed for the world to witness, his work scrutinised to the letter and twisted inside-out, there was nothing Jungkook wanted more than to walk in Taehyung’s shoes.

Their relationship formed quickly. Their connection was indefinable and attraction deep. In Taehyung, Jungkook found peace. In Jungkook, Taehyung found passion. They held their growing affections with delicacy, keeping their eyes on each other and blocking out the rest of the world.

Fear and the desperate desire to protect the light he’d found from being snuffed out by outside interference kept Jungkook’s lips sealed. He disappeared from the limelight for an extended break, because what bloomed between him and Taehyung was more important to him than anything else. Tucked away in the privacy of the life Taehyung had spent years cultivating, surrounded by people who were genuine in their care for him and his relationship, Jungkook’s eyes were opened to the wish he’d been seeking all along. He could be happy.

They sipped wine in their pyjamas, cuddled together under thick blankets with woolly socks, sitting on the couch, and talked from midnight to dawn. They spent mornings and afternoons walking in the woods with dogs they adopted, taking photographs they’d never share with anyone else just because they didn’t have to or want to. They competed for victory against one another gaming, laptops on their legs, ankles locked together as they sat on opposite ends of the couch.

Years passed by in their hidden sanctuary, where they came and went under cover of darkness, disguised and defended against curious watchers, keeping their secrets secret and falling in love. Years passed as Jungkook learned how to love without breaking, and Taehyung learned how to care for someone who had been broken down and built back up with walls that hurt more than helped.

When Jungkook entered the spotlight again, armed with new music and new confidence, things were different. He felt different, and things were better. Even when life got hard, and work sent him to cold and lonely beds, there was a warm heart waiting to hear about his day with a sincere desire to listen, to comfort when needed, to be a reminder that there was a home waiting for him to return.

They made the decision to reveal themselves to the public together, before anyone else could do it for them. The frenzy was expected, the attention was a lot, but they kept their smiles in place and the unerring love in their gazes. No questions were answered beyond vague responses and small confirmations of pride and adoration.

It had taken a decade for Jungkook to meet Taehyung, but it was worth following the invisible string that led him through a maze of endings to find a new beginning.

If there was one thing Hoseok was thankful for to the k-pop group BTS it's that they had brought the 70s back in Korea. For two years now, Hoseok had worked at the roller disco in his town, on weekends and some weekday afternoons to pay for his university fees; and never before had he enjoyed his work so much. The small skating rink was run by a friendly couple, a Korean woman and an Asian-American man who had returned when he was young to the country his parents came from in search of his roots and had ended up finding love there. These kinds of places were typical in the United States, or at least that's what Hoseok thought after seeing in several movies how the protagonists decided to go skating to the rhythm of the music on their first date. It was definitely a great place to have a good time, whether you knew how to skate or not, everyone was welcome on the dance floor. But it wasn't a very popular entertainment in Korea, where young people preferred to hang out in cybercafes or go to the cinema. But it seemed like now it was it's time to shine, with an increase in demand like Hoseok hadn't seen before.

This was due not only to the influence of BTS, but the entire K-pop industry, who seemed to had dusted off their disco looks and got ready to give it all under a big disco ball and bright neon lights. In South Korea if there were many k-pop groups going for the same aesthetic that meant that a large part of the population, especially young people, will try to imitate them, bringing back bell bottoms, knee-high boots and any garment with psychedelic prints typical of the 1970s in the United States. At that time in the US disco music became popular, with its repetitive and catchy rhythms and renowned artists such as The Jackson 5 or ABBA, and a whole cultural movement was created around it characterized by wide pants, impossible platforms and combed hair to give it as much volume as possible. In the rest of the world, the great successes within musical artist in the genre, as well as films such as Saturday Night Fever, had contributed to the popularity of disco as a whole.

However, the seventies in South Korea weren't as colorful as in the United States. Barely fifteen years had passed since the war, and its consequences were still latent among the population. And the political situation wasn't the best either, with a dictatorial regime that remained in power until the eighties, which imposed strong censorship measures. Despite all the abversities Korean people showed a great resilience that allowed them to overcome the state in which the war had left their territory, and they were able to recover and start an economic development like no other that led them in the 21th century to be one of the most advanced countries in the world, leaders of technological development. Not only was their economy strong, so was their culture, the hallyu wave expanding all over the world taking their music, series and culture to other countries incredibly far from the Southeast Asian peninsula.

Korean culture spread throughout the world, while Koreans enjoyed cultural movements from the United States. The resurgence of disco music was an example of that.

There had been several Korean artists who in a short period of time opted for the disco aesthetic for their music videos, such as GFriend or Sunmi, as well as others who did it previously like Day6 or Wonder Girls. That made many young people who weren't familiar with that genre of music typical of the seventies look up information on the subject, and they were all surprised to see that in their own city there was a place with that theme. Not long after the release of the disco-themed songs groups of young people with their best disco looks began to attend the roller disco, uploading photos and videos of them with their cool outfits having fun on social media, even some influencers went there to take advantage of the trend for outfits with bell bottoms or mini skirt and knee-high boots. The whole thing ended up going viral, and everybody on social media started to talk about Hoseok's workplace.

The roller disco has never been a crowded place, but it had always remained a profitable enough business with the events that people could organize there or the offer packages that Mr. Choi made from time to time. That had changed in the last few weeks, with a steady trickle of people during weekdays, and an incredible influx of people of all ages during the weekends. This revitalization of the business allowed Mr. Choi to put into place the idea that he had always wanted to develop when he started his business: themed parties to which people had to go disguised as much as possible in disco clothes.

When he opened roller disco the theme parties had some success, but it wasn't long before people stopped trying to dress up when they went to skate to the beat of the music. Technically, Saturdays was still the day of the thematic parties, but no one seemed to remember it, and it had become a day like any other. But now that the disco atmosphere was noticeable inside and outside the roller disco, it was the ideal moment to relaunch the idea of Mr. Choi.

They bought a large disco ball, several colored spotlights, and expanded the repertoire of songs to create the most festive atmosphere possible. Hoseok was in charge of getting the word to young people that from the following week the disco party was going to be established. He spreaded it through social media as much as he could, and from the first moment the response was very enthusiastic. So Hoseok wasn't surprised to see the large number of people who had concentrated on the doors before the opening. There were people of all kinds, young, old and families with young kids, each with a different style. There were young people characterized from head to toe, who had paid attention to imitate even the make-up of that time, as well as people who were only wearing clothes with bright colors. But no matter how they were dressed, what was really necessary was that they wanted to have fun and have a good time on the skates while moving to the rhythm of disco music, and Hoseok believed that was fulfilled. The comments on social media were all positive, and soon the parties in the roller disco became the hot topic of the city, which augured a long period of success for them"
37363471,2022,1039,,,"Nicki Minaj and Park Jimin Discover the Meaning of Dreams

Backstage at the American Music Awards, Nicki Minaj tugs at her skintight black dress which falls right above her knees. People rush in and out of her dressing room. Some mess with her hair and makeup, while others remind her of her performance in twenty minutes. She's scheduled to perform ""Do We Have A Problem?"" for the thousands in the crowd and the millions watching from home all over the globe.

Nicki has performed countless of times, a veteran in her field. She's gained confidence over the years, but she's still nervous in the minutes before walking on stage. Once she spits the first few bars, the nerves start to go away. She just has to endure the period of waiting.

""Tell everyone to leave the room,"" Nicki tells her manager, Cindy. ""Everyone needs to leave.""

Cindy begins to shout over the bustling. When no one listens, Nicki takes matters into her own hands. ""Everyone! Leave the room or you're fired!""

Her staff recognizes the command in her tone, and they begin to shuffle toward the exit, leaving her alone to process her rushing thoughts. She sits down on the couch against the wall. She takes deep breaths and runs through the lyrics in her mind. She mouths the words, getting into the familiar rhythm of the song. She'll own the stage, just like she always does.

Without looking up, Nicki senses someone at the entrance. ""I told you to leave!""

When she doesn't get a response, she looks up.

Park Jimin is dressed in a gray suit, looking stunning with his blonde hair framing his face with slightly tousled bangs. He manages a shy smile.

""Jimin?"" Nicki says. ""What are you doing here?""

Jimin looks a bit unsure of himself, moving his weight back and forth between his two feet. His English isn't quite fluent, but it's improved since Nicki talked to the group back when they released the ""IDOL"" remix. ""I wanted to talk to you,"" Jimin says simply.

""I'm performing in fifteen minutes,"" Nicki says.

Jimin doesn't move, continuing to work his charm with his smile like a weapon. ""Please?""

Nicki always has had a soft spot for the idol, and she can't resist him now—even when she needs time to get into her performance mode. ""Alright,"" she says. ""Come here.""

Jimin sits carefully next to the superstar rapper. ""I wanted to talk to you about a dream I had.""

Nicki adjusts herself to face the idol. ""I'm no dream expert,"" she says. ""But what happened in your dream?""

Jimin tilts his head to one side, looking unsure of himself. He crosses his legs and leans back against the red fabric of the couch. ""We were performing together,"" he says. ""I was rapping, and you were singing. It was like we exchanged roles. The crowd was completely silent when we finished. It was like a black ocean.""

Nicki leans back as well, getting comfortable as she processes Jimin's dream. ""Well, it could mean that you fear changing your persona on stage. And the black ocean part—you fear the crowd not liking you if you do something different from what they expect.""

""You think so?"" Jimin nods slowly. ""That actually makes a lot of sense.""

Nicki pauses to decide whether she should share more—she and the idol aren't that close, but perhaps her vulnerability might help the boy not fear his dreams. ""I had a dream recently too,"" she says. ""I was on stage and suddenly, the whole arena lit on fire. I couldn't move. I just stood there as I watched everything go up in flames—my fans, the set, and eventually me.""

""Sounds so scary,"" Jimin says.

Nicki smiles, processing the silence that now stretches between them. It's not an awkward silence, it's comfortable, and it feels like the two of them are closer in just a manner of minutes. Nicki doesn't regret sharing with Jimin, when the two of them both understand just how terrifying it could be to put yourself out to the world. All the judgment, criticism, and good and bad attention can really change someone. And it's up to them to choose to be changed for the better. Nicki reaches out, placing a hand on Jimin's shoulder.

""I'm glad you told me about your dream,"" she says. ""But I don't think you have to worry. Your fans love you, and they won't give you up just because you change like any normal person would.""

""What about the part of performing together?"" Jimin asks.

Nicki grins. She's been wanting to perform with BTS for years, ever since the ""IDOL"" remix came out. ""I'll check my schedule. I think I can join you when you hold your concert in LA.""

""I'm looking forward to it,"" Jimin says. ""You know, Nicki, you're actually very thoughtful and kind.""

Nicki laughs, even as she flushes from the compliment. She's always wanted to have a deeper conversation with Jimin—the idol not afraid to break gender roles and still maintain a childlike purity in front of the cameras. Even off camera, she is pleasantly surprised at his soft personality, like every word he chooses is because of his careful thinking. Nicki realizes that even if Jimin might be shy at first, once he opens up she'll discover a whole world of his light and kindness. Suddenly, she is thankful that she didn't turn him away at the door. She needed this.

""Can I give you a hug?"" Jimin says.

Nicki isn't one to kiss and hug, especially before a performance, but she'll make an exception for this boy. ""Of course,"" she says.

Jimin smells like musk and cinnamon, and Nicki breathes in deep as they loops their arms around one another. A warm feeling settles into the base of Nicki's stomach, telling her that she might've just made a new friend.

""Thank you for this, Nicki,"" Jimin says.

And the queen of rap, the hard persona that she often uses, melts away. She's just a woman in need of comfort—just like Park Jimin does. Just like the rest of BTS, her fans, and even those who don't give a shit about her.

She's just glad she's found someone to share her dreams with.

Title is from the song, ""Heartbeat"" by Christopher ♡

When Jeongguk was little, his mom knew her son was a little different from their peers.

""Jeongguk, you need to eat your vegetables. It'll help you grow strong and healthy like your hyungs.""

""But it tastes icky.""

""That's garlic, baby. It's good for you.""

""No, eomma, I don't like it.""

""But–""

""I promise to eat all the other ones, please don't make me eat garlic.""

""I– okay, baby. Now finish your food.""

How peculiar. What Korean doesn't like garlic? His mom would contemplate as she looked upon her son carefully picking out the cloves and stacking them on the corner of his plate.

–––

""Jeongguk, talk to me. Why are you crying?""

""Jin-hyung bit me because I was hugging him too tight. He hates me..""

""Oh, baby. He doesn't hate you. maybe try hugging him a little softer next time, yeah?""

""Okay. I'll try.""

–––

He and his hyungs were on their way to the beach for a little vacation.

""Jeongguk, we're going to a beach. Why are you covered up?""

""The sun is hot, hyung. Excuse me for not wanting my skin to burn!""

""Okay, but don't blame us if you like, get a heatstroke or something.""

""Jimin-ssi, the ocean's right there. I'll be fine, don't worry.""

It's times like these, with his hyungs being extra rowdy and touchy with one another, that he feels the stark difference. As a beta, he's learned to love being the odd man out, more of a mediator than instigator.

He sometimes prefers it even.

And sometimes, as he looks at them smiling and in relationships, he begins to wonder why that is.

–––

He's tried dating, of course. It was always a fun experience but eventually the sparks passed and his partners soon grew tired of him. The break-ups were inevitable, but mutually accepted.

He ponders this as he walks to the convenience store late one night, craving for some ramen.

When suddenly, the sky overhead darkens with clouds so purple, he feels like he's transported to another dimension.

As goosebumps rise on his skin, he sees him.

A man, pale as white snow, standing at the other side of the road, staring right at him.

Bracing himself, he walks closer, instincts telling him to do so.

""It's you. I've been waiting my whole life for you.""

Jeongguk notices the pale skin, the way the other doesn't seem to take heavy breaths. ""You're a vampire.""

""And you smell like a dog. A little unorthodox I must admit, but we can't all choose our soulmates, can't we?""

""Soulmates?""

""You don't feel it?""

He does. He's been feeling the tug from the very first moment they've caught sight of one another. Like the end of a lifeline, like a hole in his heart has been made larger just to accommodate the other.

""I'm Jeongguk. It's nice to meet you.""

""Yoongi. The pleasure's all mine.""

–––

It's been months since they've met and began dating. Despite the many adjustments, they've come to love one another.

Jeongguk is happy, learning a lot about Yoongi and himself.

He smiles, wistfully remembering most of their conversations at the beginning of their relationship.

–––

""What are you doing, Gguk-ah?""

""I'm setting aside the garlic, I don't like them.""

""Oh! Can I have them?""

""Do you like garlic? But you're a vampire, hyung.""

""What can I say? I'm Korean, it's a staple. One of the things I liked eating before I turned, actually. And one of the human foods I can still stomach.""

It's strange, but he understands. ""Okay, hyung. I'll make sure to save all of mine for you.""

–––

They're with the pack and Jeongguk notices Yoongi on his phone. ""What are you looking at?""

""Resorts. I've been thinking we could go to the beach for our six-month anniversary.""

""Won't you like, disintegrate?"" Jeongguk asks warily.

""Oh my moons. I can't believe my soulmate's stereotyping me.""

""No! That's not what I meant!""

""Baby! It was just a joke. I'll probably have to cover up from head to toe, but we'll have fun, I promise.""

Jeongguk drops his face in his hands, trying to ignore the raucous laughter from his friends.

""There's two of them!""

–––

""Can I ask you a question?""

""Of course, hyung.""

""Do you not– like touching me? I know my skin can run a little cold, but you don't have to be scared. I'll never hurt you.""

""Oh! No, hyung! nothing like that! It's just–I don't know how?""

""How–to hug?""

""Whenever my packmates would cuddle or touch me, it always made me a little too conscious. What if I'm too clingy? What if they didn't like my scent? What if their soulmates got mad? What if I accidentally kill them from squeezing too hard? Just–you know, the usual.""

""Come here.""

""But–""

""Come here, baby."" Yoongi takes his hands and places Jeongguk on his lap. ""Jeongguk, I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm a vampire. Unless you hug me with a stake in your hand, there's physically no way I'd die from your cuddles.""

Jeongguk smiles, feeling the reassurance tearing his doubts.

Yoongi smothers his face in between Jungkook's shoulder blades, ""I love your scent. Reminds me of the flowing leaves in spring.""

Jeongguk mutters petulantly, ""You told me before that I smell like a dog.""

""I love dogs!""

They both share a smile when Bam raises his head to bark, seemingly in agreement.

He squeezes Jeongguk's waist, so, so close. ""And I'm your soulmate, the only one that should get mad is that good boy over there.""

Jeongguk giggles and Yoongi squeezes, closer and closer still, wiggling their bodies from side to side, ""Besides, I've been waiting for you my whole life, there's not a chance I'm letting you go.""

–––

Jeongguk loves how sometimes his vampire boyfriend seems less vampire than him. It's as if their bodies were adjusting to each other before they even met, giving little hints that their red strings were attached.

And maybe that's just it.

Maybe their differences were what made them compatible. Maybe their differences were what made their souls complete.

Author's Note:

Hello again! I'm back and I've added more content into the first chapter.
I've kept most of the traditional a/b/o themes but modified a few things. All packs have a pack home near forests so that they can change easily and not worry about non-wolves. These pack homes are normally used over holidays/breaks and such and everyone has individual homes in the cities.
Humans and werewolves live together and know of each other's existence. There are laws protecting both parties from discrimination and such.

Summary for the Chapter:

Jungkook is nursing his divorce sorrows in Namjoon and Yoongi's bar.

Notes for the Chapter:

I might still add content here! Once it's edited, I'll be deleting this note.

Jungkook is sitting by the bar and sipping on his whiskey. It's well over their closing time, but his hyungs own the bar and are okay with him staying. They are cleaning up for the night, he should help and be productive, but he just sighs. His scent is rotten and sour. He's glad they haven't kicked him out yet. One sad alpha is bad enough, but an angry and sad alpha is just alarm bells ringing.

Yoongi wants to reach out and talk to him, but the scent is so potent his omega wavers. When Namjoon comes closer, he decides it's okay to talk to the young alpha. ""Kook-ah, this isn't healthy. You've barely had food this week, and you can't keep drinking away."" He hears the younger sign. His scent wilts further, and then, the sharpness rises. It's hard for his omega to stay this close to Kook, but he powers on for the younger. Namjoon notices his discomfort and lets out a warning growl. ""Jungkook, we're okay with you staying here, but you must control your scent.""

The sorrow rises in Jungkook's scent. It smells like a dying flame. They've never seen him so broken, not even when Hannie first fell sick. The divorce was so sudden. None of the hyungs expected their happy maknae couple to be struggling so much. The two of them were always putting on a happy face and hiding away their pain. It hurts to see them like this.

""He left hyung,"" the sobs rip out of this throat. It's getting hard to breathe. ""Must find omega, must keep omega safe."" his alpha has been repeating this over and over, like a broken record. ""failed omega, failed to keep omega happy"" his alpha is sobbing too now. Jungkook is almost gasping for air as his heartbroken sobs continue. Yoongi cannot watch his pup, his little brother, in so much pain and tries to release calming pheromones. Namjoon is doing the same too. But Jungkook cannot focus on them. He cannot focus on anything other than the fact that he failed his mate.

""Jungkook, pup, breathe with me"" it's Seokjin who finally calms the distressed alpha down. Namjoon had called him down here once they closed cause he knows Jungkook would need all of their support. Hobi and Jimin were with Tae. They can console Tae for the night. Seokjin crowds into Jungkook's space places his hand on the alpha's chest and forces him to do the same, all while adding his pheromones to the already potent mix. It helps break Jungkook out of his spiral. He's breathing better now, his sobs are dying down. The air is a mix of calm and tinging sorrow. It's putting everyone on edge.

""Pup,"" Jin continues, cradling Kook's head to his chest, letting him calm down and relax into him. ""Please, pup, you need to calm down. Your scent is"", he trails off, not wanting to upset the alpha. Jungkook tries to control his scent. It's hard without his omega here to help him repress it. Mated couples can restrain their scents much better and quicker when they are with their mates.

""Please, hyungs, make the pain stop,"" he pleads. His voice is hoarse from all the crying and lack of use. He's not felt this broken in years and doesn't know what to do. He has no home to go to tonight, nowhere to rest, and no one to come home to. When Tae sent him the divorce papers, he decided to leave the house to his mate. Omegas need their nests to feel safe, and he doesn't want Tae moving anywhere. He's been sleeping in a different hotel room every night and is so tired. His heart is worn.

He glances down at the tattoo on his arms, the tiger lily mocking him with the phrase ""Please love me"". Taehyung loved him. His omega loved him and courted him. He was the one that broke the relationship. He wasn't worthy of love. Wasn't worthy of being Tae's mate. His movements get frantic as he tries to scratch off the tattoo. Not worthy of love. Not worthy of Tae. Failed his mate. None of the others know what's going on the in the maknae's mind but they can see his desparation as he tries to scratch the tattoo. It's Namjoon who stops him this time. He can't take the pain he sees in the younger and pulls him into a hug. Holding him in his arms as he finally realized what Jungkook was doing. ""It's okay Kook. You loved him and he loved you. You'll eventually get better. You can love and be loved again.""

This does nothing to help the alpha but he finally stops scratching his arm. Its red and sore now, but he's done. He's cried out all his emotions and can't think anymore. He just wants to sleep and forget everything. ""Hyun"" his speech slurs as he leans completely against Namjoon. His Joonie hyung will keep him safe. ""Wanna go home"" he continues to slur as his hyung subtly tenses. ""Wanna sleep"" he mummers before dozing into Namjoon's chest. The other sigh in relief. Damage control has been done for the night. They can finally close up the bar and take Jungkook to the pack home.

Jin's already leaving to pull the car up front, when Yoongi stops him. ""Make sure it's clean"" he whispers to Jin, trying hard not to disturb the maknae. ""There shouldn't be anything to trigger him"", he continues as he guides Jin towards the door. He grabs a spray can near the exit and hands it to Jin. ""Spray the car before you bring it out front so that he can just relax during the ride home."" Jin nods, taking the can and understanding the hidden message. Check for Taehyung's belongings and scent before getting Jungkook into the car.

It's nearly 3 am by the time they all stumble into the pack house. Exhausted by the events of the day they all sprawl onto the den without really checking the house. If only they had."

Author's P.O.V.

Yoongi huff in annoyance while looking at Hoseok who's busy on his phone.

It's Saturday and they were suppose to cuddle while watching T.V. but Hoseok's secretary called making the hybrid irritated.

""I want cuddles right now but that woman called my hoseokie for the seventh time"" Yoongi mumbles and crossed his arms on his chest.

Hoseok took a glance on his hybrid and was suprised when he saw the older glaring at him.

""Sir? Are you there?"" his secretary called him from the phone, Hoseok looks away from the hybrid and looks outside instead.

""I'm sorry what's that again?"" he ask Portia (His secretary).

""Mr. Lee wants to have a meeting with you this coming wednesday, he wants to talk to you about the collaboration between his model and your models sir"" Portia said, Hoseok hummed and thinks.

""Models? Which of my models he wants to collaborate with?"" Hoseok ask secretly taking glances at the sulking hybrid.

""Kim Taehyung and Park Jimin sir"" Portia replied and Hoseok hums again ""And who's his model?""

""Mr. Jeon Jungkook sir"" the secretary replied and Hoseok choke on his spit ""Jungkook? As in the 'Jeon Jungkook'?"" he ask unbelievingly.

""Yes sir""

He place his fingers on his chin and sink what his secretary said in his brain ""O-okay, tell him the meeting is settled"" he said.

""Yes sir"", ""Is there any appointments, meeting or projects?"" Hoseok ask.

""There's none sir"" Portia replied and Hosoek sighs in relief ""Okay, Thank you Portia""

""You're welcome sir"" after that Hoseok end the call and went back to the couch, he was confuse Yoongi's gone.

""Yoongi? Kitten where are you?"" he called out and look for the hybrid.

""Where did he go?"" he mumbles and went to the kitchen but Yoongi's still not there.

He went to the bathroom, the basement and the garden but the hybrid is nowhere to be found, he starts to panicks.

He went back to the living room and almost screams when he saw Yoongi beside the couch, glaring at him in his cat form.

""Kitten where have you been? I panicked when I couldn't find you"" Hoseok said and went towards the glaring cat.

But Yoongi just let out a meow and walks away, clearly avoiding Hoseok.

""Kitten? Where are you going? I thought we're gonna cuddle and watch your favorite show?"" Hoseok said confusingly but Yoongi just ignored him.

(^･ｪ･^)

Yoongi's laying flat on his stomach in the living room, his ears went up as he looks back and saw Hoseok smiling at him.

""Why is he smiling like that?"" he thought and watches his owner sat down on the couch.

""Hey Kitten, I brought your favorite fruit"" Hoseok said and shows the raspberry at Yoongi.

The cat sat up and looks at him boredly, Hoseok grins secretly as he feeds Yoongi but...

Hoseok jaw drop when Yoongi walks away from him and went up the shelves and sat right there.

""Kitten you don't want to eat raspberry? But It's your favorite"" Hoseok said but Yoongi just stared at him boredly before laying down.

""Hyung are you upset?"" he ask but he got no answer ""Hyung come here"" he said again while patting his thigh but the cat just ignored him.

Hoseok sighs and plops down on the couch ""This is the first time he ignored me"" he mumbles and took a glance on Yoongi, who's swinging his tail back and forth.

(^･ｪ･^)

40 minutes later Hoseok stood up and turns the T.V. off making the cat look at him.

Yoongi watches Hoseok went upstairs, he got down from the shelf and went towards the table to eat the raspberries on the plate.

After he finished eating all the berries he lick his paw and looks back when he heard a chuckle.

""Sheesh, I know you'll eat those when I'm gone"" Hoseok said smiling, Yoongi let out a deep meow before jumping off the table.

""And where do you think you're going?"" Hoseok said before picking up the cat who hissed at him.

""Is my kitty hyungie upset? Why are you upset hmm?"" Hoseok ask as he nuzzle his face on the cat's tummy.

Yoongi let out a 'meow' and put his paws on Hoseok nose.

""Can you shift back into your human form hyung?"", ""Mao""

""Why no? Do you want me to brush your fur?"" Hoseok ask but Yoongi just said ""Mao"" which is 'no'

""How about we'll play in the garden?"", ""Mao""

""I'll give you a warm bath?"", ""MAOOOO!""

""Okay, okay sheesh you're feisty hyung"" Hoseok said and sighs, he looks at the cat who glares at him.

""Come on hyung, why are you acting like this? Did I do something wrong?"" he ask but Yoongi just swings his tail from left to right.

""Shift on your human form hyung please, let's talk about this hyungie"" Hoseok pleaded with a sad voice.

Yoongi place his paw on Hoseok cheeks and let's out a soft 'meow'

""Are you going to shift?"" Hoseok ask and Yoongi swings his tail cheerfully.

""Okay""

(^･ｪ･^)

""Hoseok-ah, stop squishing me"" Yoongi said and squirms ""Sorry kitten"" Hoseok said and Yoongi softly flicks his forehead.

""Ouch"", ""I didn't even flick that hard""

Hoseok just chuckles and sat up making Yoongi straddles him then he held on the older's waist.

""Now hyung, tell me why are you upset earlier?"" Hoseok ask, Yoongi mumbles something but he didn't heared it.

""Say it a little louder hyung, I can't hear you"" he said and the older frowns.

""I said, I want you to focus on me only, I don't like it when you excuse yourself to answer a call from work"" Yoongi said while looking down.

""Oh, I'm sorry Kitty hyungie I wouldn't do it again"" Hoseok said and hugs him ""Hoseok-ah, I-i can't breathe"" the older said and pats Hoseok shoulders.

Hoseok breaks the hug and smiles ""Hehe sorry"" he said and Yoongi hums ""Now let's watch your favorite show"" Hoseok said.

""No"", ""Huh? Why hyung?""

""I wanna sleep"" Yoongi said then yawns, Hoseok coos and caresse the older's hair ""Sure let's go, I'll cuddle you until you fall asleep"" He said.

""I would love that"""

Author's Note:

Inspired by a prompt on tumblr. I can't give what it said, since that would ruin the point of this fic, right? It's bakery themed ok.

Requests from any fandom are welcome. I do not own you, nor do I own my sons. Sometimes you lose custody.

The quiet man’s gaze swept over your selection of cakes, an expression full of disdain on his features when he found that the flavor of his choosing happened to be out of stock. He ran a few fingers through his hair – it was a mint green this time, you noticed, since he held a liking to dying his hair – and sighed. He thumbed through his pocket, money of exact change just sitting there idly upon seeing that he had lucked out.

“You’re out?” he muttered, lips pressing downwards, as if his annoyance hadn’t already been expressed. You thought that such a man who had such a rough and rugged exterior wouldn’t order strawberry shortcake every time he arrived. A light, fluffy and borderline cute selection didn’t quite match the way he looked and most of all, acted. He never said more than a few words to you, and his order was the same in every way each time when he picked up his cake. Only on certain occasions would he reserve one so he could drive by and have it ready for him, and it was a reason unknown even to you. But you figured he kind of knew that strawberry shortcake was almost always stocked up, since it seemed to be a favorite selection of his and many other customers, especially around summertime. Why? You weren’t sure. Maybe it was a summertime cake? But to you, cakes weren’t seasonal unless specifically designed for them. Still, the man standing in front of you was fond of it, and you saw the disappointment crinkling his forehead and tightening his lips and darkening his eyes. “Unfortunate.”

“Sorry,” you murmured, “would you like something else?” When he shook his head, turning to leave, you realized that purposely leaving out an essential detail about the cakes was cruel, and you blurted, “We have one more baking.” He stopped his stride midway and angled his body towards yours. “In the back.” You inwardly sighed, relieved when you saw him inching back towards the counter.

“Another strawberry shortcake?” His voice was deep, husky even, and you found your cheeks heating up at the sound of it.

“Yeah, the timer hasn’t rang yet, and I didn’t expect for you to come yet, so…” You refrained from telling him that you also might have ordered just enough supplies, so you could bake one more for him, although it was thirty minutes until closing time. He visited the bakery sporadically, and it was often that he did so around your evening shift, never intruding too late when you were cleaning up but never painfully punctual either. It was a nice time-frame, in your opinion. It kind of gave you another reason to smile before locking up – not that you were looking for one. Or anything.

“Thanks.” He didn’t have to say anything more for you to know that he appreciated your kind gesture greatly, even if he didn’t know the details of your preparation.

“Sure –” The sound of the timer resonated throughout the room, and you smiled apologetically before scurrying to fetch the cake so you could start washing up. Placing the cake into the colorfully decorated box, you closed the lid and started undoing the tie of your apron. The logo glared at you when you folded the piece of cloth and set it on the table, and you silently thanked the founder before making your way out of the kitchen. Your eyes softened when you saw the man still waiting patiently at the counter, and you murmured a quiet thank you before charging him the given amount. Briefly eyeing him open the lid and fiddle with something in the box, you shrugged and locked up the register. “Have a nice day!”

He turned to leave the store, but he had left the cake on the counter, clearly aware that he was about to make his departure empty handed.

You stared at it for a moment before calling, “Hey, aren’t you going to take the cake?”

“Keep it.”

“But – then, you can – I didn’t have to charge you –” You were fumbling with the right words to say, but he had already stalked off, leaving you a stuttering mess by yourself. “That guy…who does he think he is?” you groaned, taking the opportunity to clean up the utensils and counters with an annoyed demeanor. “Why did he give me money if he wasn’t even going to eat it?” You had to admit, it was a bit childish for you to be frustrated when in the end, he probably didn’t mind at all; but you had went out of your way to bake another cake for him! The least he could do was accept it…

Sighing, you decided it would indeed be a waste to throw it in the trash so you didn’t hesitate to take it home with you. And naturally, the ride home wasn’t any less unnerving because you were so lost in your thoughts. You supposed that you were just reading too much into it, but you were still kind of offended. Did he have to be so stoic? Did he read the script for a drama and decide to act it out based on a whim? Did he think he was doing you a favor?

Kicking off your shoes and plopping down on the couch with a fork in hand, you knew the cake would be devoured within a few days anyway. It would be a shame to be sad about a free cake that wasn’t even at your expense. You should just be grateful.

Opening the square lid, you glared at the folded sticky note that was perched on the paper that was used as protection underneath the cake. It was a sticky note from your bakery, you knew, because there was a suggestions and requests box on the counter by the display. From what you could recall, you didn’t put one next to the cake…?

With a furrow in your brow, you unfolded the note, realizing that upon closer inspection, it was a series of numbers next to a name. Yoongi. “Why, that little –”

Author's Note:

Just based on a speculation my friend and I came up with.

""Jimin's mother,"" she rests her cheek on her palm, elbow propped up on the table littered with cosmetics, as she scrolls through her Instagram feed with her free hand. ""Really?""

He smiles sheepishly at her from the mirror. ""I panicked. You know it can't be revealed. Yet.""

""I know."" She sighs, ""But it's just... not really convincing.""

""How so?""

""Well, as a frequent visitor of your fanpages, I know that fans already posted and shared pictures they found of your actual parents, with their faces clearly shown.""

""But your face was blocked by a sticker in the picture, though.""

""My eyes are. The rest aren't,"" she holds out her phone to him, clicking on the picture to maximize it. ""And those features are enough for scrutiny. If you analyze, you'll see the difference of our faces.""

""But don't you usually don't analyze these things?""

She waves a finger from side-to-side. ""You seem to underestimate your fans. Especially the hardcore ones.""

""Like you?"" he grins, reaching out and tickling under her chin.

She smiles and grabs his long-sleeve-swallowed-hand and holds it on her lap. ""Yes, Park Jimin. The likes of me would start investigating to make sure you're still single.""

He doesn't seem perturbed by this anymore. ""I see. I should've said you're a cousin.""

""Or, we shouldn't have posed in a picture together in the first place.""

""Hmm,"" he purses his lips, as if hard in thought. ""What do we do now, then?""

""Nothing.""

He frowns, confused. ""I thought we have a problem?""

""We do, but it's actually a bit shallow. Doing something about it would only make stuff more suspicious than it already is. Small issues would just disappear if you leave it alone, right? Like usual.""

""But?""

She smiles again at his perceptiveness. ""We could at least prevent any repeats. So no more pictures with me, I guess.""

""Whaaaat?"" He pouts. ""But I want lots of pictures with you.""

""Oh my gosh, stop being so cute,"" she nuzzles his hand that she now held in both of hers. ""I meant,"" she looks back up, ""no more pictures to be released to the public with me in them.""

""I know,"" he giggles, ""I'm just messing with you, jagi.""

It's her turn to pout. ""Oh, Chiminie, bad Chiminieee~"" she pinches his cheek. ""No PDA, or anything close to PDA, either.""

He frowns again and sighs. ""It’s really so unfair.""

""I know, but we can't risk getting attention worthy enough for pictures.""

""But we rarely get time to ourselves. Private, personal time for just the two of us. I just wanted to cherish you as much as I could whenever I’m actually able to physically be with you.""

Her face warms up. ""I—you’re killing me here, you know?""

Jimin grins then, all traces of seriousness melting away.

""But really, we need to consider the situation if we want to make this work.""

""I understand."" He brings one of her hands to his lips. ""I wouldn't have dragged you into this if I don’t know the risks. It just gets frustrating sometimes.""

""Oh, trust me, I know. Gosh, I'd be lying if I said I don't want to hug you most of the time.”

""Just hugging?"" he smirks.

""...We have our private times together for anything more than that.""

""Like now?""

""You finally caught on,"" she playfully rolls her eyes as she leans into his hand now on her cheek. ""Besides, you don't need to be affectionate in public to make me understand how you feel.""

""You're really the best, jagi,"" he moves closer to her.

The door to the dressing room suddenly opens, prompting them both to sit back upright to leave a considerably safe distance from each other.

In come Taehyung, walking straight towards them to sift through the messy pile of makeup on the table.

""What is it, Taehyungie?"" Jimin asks when the boy starts moving around the room.

""I think I left my phone in here,"" Taehyung answers without glancing back at them.

Tapping sounds echo through the room before Taehyung's ringtone went off, revealing the phone half-underneath a pillow as it dangerously hung on a sofa's armrest.

Taehyung immediately crosses the room to retrieve it before it could really fall. He checks the caller ID, and then turns to the girl who just put her phone away from her ear. ""Wow, thanks, Jimin's mom.""

She groans. ""Not again.""

Ruffling her hair, Jimin giggles along with his friend.

""Stop laughing,"" she says, but smiles anyway.

""Don't be too upset,"" Taehyung continues. ""I sensed his slight panic back there.""

""So he confirms,"" she replies.

""Or maybe it's also a kink?""

That freezes the couple up, a light blush spreading through Jimin’s ears as he watched his girlfriend’s eyes widen then darting to look at anywhere but him, her cheeks sporting the same color as his hair.

He gulps. Jimin cranes his neck at the younger's direction. ""Out, Taehyung, out,""

One last chuckle was heard before Taehyung exits.

A moment of silence.

""Hey, um,"" Jimin starts, successfully eliciting a shy glance from her, ""come here."" He pats his leg.

She blinks twice, yet obliges. Settling herself on his lap, she hides her face in his neck as he wraps an arm around her.

""Don't believe what he said, it isn't like that at all,"" he continues.

""He really says everything that comes to mind, huh?"" she laughs. ""But yeah, that was a bit uncomfortable.""

""Bursting in to interrupt us, then saying something disturbing before he leaves. Aish, that kid.""

She lifts her head and nudges his shoulder. ""He didn't mean to interrupt us. And you made him leave.""

""Because he’s out of line again! Hmph,"" he puffs his cheeks out. He looks at her, but soon had to turn away again as he fought another blush. ""Y-you won't like it, though?""

""What?""

""Me having a mommy ki—“

""I don't think I would.""

He giggles, sweeping a hand through her hair as he gives her a side-glance. ""Okay, because I don't have one.""

She buries her face again in his neck, almost muffling her next words. ""I don't either, daddy.""

The hand in her hair falls to her shoulder to give it a light but firm squeeze, as she feels his neck grow hot. ""You know, I actually meant you are 'Park Jimin's mom to his future kids'. Just left out the details we still can't reveal to the public.""

""Mmhmm, okay.""

He gently tilts her head to look up at him. ""That's all you have to say?""

""I'm glad you're thinking that far ahead,"" she Eskimo-kisses him and grins, ""but that would've been smoother if it wasn't so delayed.""

Yoongi knows; he knows that he shouldn't be doing this. He knows the difference between fantasy and reality, but sometimes reality is so unappealing he'd rather stay within his own personal bubble for a little while longer.

Yoongi knows; he knows that he has responsibilities. He knows he has things to do, raps to be written and melodies to be finished, but sometimes he just wants to sit back and relax because all of that can get a little overwhelming.

Yoongi knows; he knows that it's wrong. He knows he should be concentrating on the page of unfinished lyrics placed in front of him, but sometimes he just wants to sit and stare at something a little more pleasant. Take Jimin, for example. Everything he does, may it be simply just talking in his gentle voice or the way he just looks at Yoongi like he's the only person in the world, he finds it comforting.

After Jimin had broken down in front of him one night, tears pouring from his eyes and gasping breaths, Yoongi had taken it upon himself to make sure Jimin was always okay. He ignored the other member's complaining and teasing, telling Yoongi he's being too overbearing. But there's something about Jimin which captivates Yoongi at all the wrong times, and yet he can't seem to care. Maybe it's that extra shine in Jimin's eyes whenever he laughs, he's not too sure.

Jimin knows - it'd be hard not to notice - that Yoongi watches him a lot. The lingering stare is somewhat unnerving as it feels like Yoongi is drilling holes into the back of his head sometimes. Yet, Jimin doesn't really mind. He has no problem meeting Yoongi's gaze, most of the time he's initiating it first, but he wants to ask why Yoongi does it, (""Why don't you stare at someone better looking? I must give you sore eyes."") but he's never too sure when would be the best time to ask, because whenever he approaches Yoongi, the latter walks away. (""You're the most beautiful person I know, to be honest."")

Yoongi really wants to tell him - he really does - but the words never come out right. He sometimes looks at the back of Jimin's head, cue cards with what he has to say ready in his mind, (""Jimin, I really like you. Like, a lot. More than a friend."") but when Jimin turns around after Yoongi calls his name, everything flies out of the window and he's left defenceless and gaping at him. Jimin still smiles though, gums not quite showing, waiting for him to say something. (""I kind of guessed. And I, um, guess I like you too."")

Yoongi thought that loving playing around with words, writing them down, crafting them and spewing them out to a large crowd would give him the upper hand in confessing. But that doesn't seem to be the case when it concerns Jimin; there's a million words he could say, and yet none of them will do.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Jimin is a little confused. He's confused because he knows Yoongi likes him, but he doesn't do anything about it. Jimin can feel holes being drilled into the back of his head again, and he is starting to get a little annoyed. He’s trying to read his comic, but it’s getting increasingly hard when he feels like someone is staring at him.

Jimin huffs and looks over his shoulder, ""Why do you keep staring at me?""

Yoongi is shocked - the expression gives it all away, ""I. Um. I don't?""

Jimin can hear the TV playing quietly in the background, and by the sounds of the obnoxiously over done yelling, it's one of Yoongi's favourite shows.

""You do, hyung. I can feel your eyes on the back of my head and it's kind of annoying."" Jimin snaps, glaring at Yoongi.

""Oh, I-, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to annoy you."" Yoongi averts his eyes to the opposite side of the room and gulps, a hot flush settling upon his cheeks as he bites his lip.

Jimin deflates, suddenly feeling bad for snapping at Yoongi. He furrows his eyebrows and gets up off his chair at the dining table to take a seat next to Yoongi on the sofa, their thighs pressing hesitantly together. Jimin places his hand carefully on Yoongi's knee.

""Have I done something wrong?"" Jimin takes a mental note on how Yoongi visibly stiffens up at the touch.

""No,"" Yoongi wets his lips and looks at Jimin, ""You're just, uh, interesting to look at?""

Jimin raises an eyebrow, and he's just about to his mouth to reply and-

Yoongi's lips are on his.

Jimin gasps, eyes wide and mouth still slightly open as Yoongi still presses his lips against his. Yoongi screws his eyes closed and fists the material of Jimin's t-shirt, pulling him closer to provoke a reaction. Jimin lets his eyes flutter shut slowly as he moves his lips along with Yoongi's, his fingertips digging into Yoongi's knee as he shuffled closer.

Yoongi bites Jimin's lower lip softly and the both of them let out a content sigh. Jimin slides his other hand to the base of Yoongi's neck as Yoongi pushes him down onto the cushions. He pulls back briefly, looking up at Yoongi who's hovering above him.

Yoongi leans down again, shifting slightly so he's more comfortable and brushes his nose against Jimin's.

Jimin is here, right in front of him, and he likes him back.

There's a lump in his throat, and he really wants to tell Jimin everything. How much he means to him, how much he likes him, how much he cares for him, but he can't seem to swallow past the lump. He searches Jimin's eyes, and there's a soft smile on Jimin's face that reassures Yoongi that everything's okay.

Yoongi places his palm on Jimin's cheek, a grin blooming across his face before he presses his lips against Jimin's again.

(""I think I might love you. Just a little bit, though."")

(""That's good then, because I love you just a little bit too."")"

prompt for anon on tumblr: can i get a yoonseok pre relationship with yoongz crushing on hobi during late nite conversations????

“Hey,” Hoseok murmurs and Yoongi turns to look at him, following the sharp angle of his jaw all the way to his chin, up to his lips. “Do you ever wonder what we would be like in another lifetime?”

“Hmm?” Yoongi’s heart thumps a little unevenly and all he can do is hum in response, not trusting his voice.

Of course he’s wondered. He wonders on nights where Hoseok feels impossibly far away and all he can do is press play for the millionth time on Hoseok’s favorite song, when sleep evades him because he’s too busy counting Hoseok’s smiles instead of sheep. He wonders when their hands brush together and Hoseok doesn’t pull back. He wonders when Hoseok smiles and the sun dims its light in favor of letting its favorite pupil shine more brightly.

He wonders and he wonders some more until Hoseok shows up on his doorstep with take-out food and movie suggestions on the tip of his tongue despite the late hour. He wonders until Hoseok squeezes Yoongi’s hand a little tighter when he’s scared, when he’s pulling Yoongi to whatever destination, when he’s telling a particularly riveting story. He wonders until Hoseok turns that brilliant smile unto him and his universe once again floods with light and warmth.

“Like…” Hoseok pauses, picking his words carefully and slowly like he does most of the time when he’s with Yoongi, when he knows he won’t get ridiculed for saying what’s really on his mind instead of what’s expected of him. When he knows he can be fragile. “I don’t know, what if, in one lifetime we’re famous? You and me. Maybe a few other people, because I don’t know if we’d really make it on our own, between our looks and distinct lack of singing ability…”

Yoongi feels his lips tug upwards of their own accord when Hoseok shoots him a wry grin. He wants to tell Hoseok that his voice is Yoongi’s favorite, that the rasping lull is more comforting than any embrace he’s ever had from his mother, warmer than any blanket after a long day. He wants to tell Hoseok he’s the most beautiful man he’s ever seen because Hoseok finds new ways every day- every breath, really- to be beautiful.

Instead, he keeps quiet. There’s always a time and a place and right now, he’d rather spend his time being lost in the worlds Hoseok is building for them, around them, directly underfoot and forever above them.

“Or maybe, we’re detectives, cracking heartbreaking cold cases that everyone else gave up on. I think we’d be pretty good at that, don’t you think? We have a good-cop bad-cop thing we could probably elaborate on, since you’ve got that uncanny ability to make everyone think you’re grumpy when you’re just shy.”

Hoseok sighs softly, contentedly, when Yoongi runs his fingers through his hair.

“Yeah, we’d be pretty good at that ‘cause for some reason, people trust you so damn easily. You could say hello and they’d be ready to give out their credit card number, their social, anything you asked for.”

Hoseok cocks an eyebrow then, a low chuckle slipping past his lips.

“I think that sounds a little bit more like a crook than a detective, don’t you, hyung? We could make a living that way too. Maybe in some other lifetime, we’re Bonnie and Clyde. I bet we could become millionaires on nothing but luck and a few bullets. What’s a little bloodshed in the grand scheme of things, eh?”

Yoongi laughs and Hoseok’s grin widens in response. He switches to massaging lightly at Hoseok’s scalp, watching in fascination as Hoseok’s eyes flutter shut. The way his eyelashes cast shadows on those gorgeous cheekbones could be art, as far as Yoongi is concerned.

“Maybe in another, we’re ruthless CEO’s. Something like frenemies, maybe? Healthy competition never hurt anyone, I suppose. It’s not like we don’t already compete as it is, that wouldn’t be too far off.”

“There’s a pretty big difference between being wolves in sheep’s clothing at the head of big businesses and competing in Super Smash Bro’s, Hoseok.”

“Yeah yeah,” Hoseok waves a hand dismissively, peeking open one eye at Yoongi. “You’re just aching to rain on my parade, huh hyung?”

“It’s what I live for.” Yoongi agrees, trying his damnedest not to smile when Hoseok gives a long-suffering sigh.

“Of course it is.” Hoseok agrees, wrinkling his nose playfully.

Maybe, Yoongi thinks during the momentary lull in conversation, in another lifetime I’m not too scared to reach out and hold you on my own. Maybe I can tell you how you make me better every time I see you, or how you make me wish there were more seconds in the day so I could see you smile just a little bit longer. Maybe I can learn to slow dance with you, like you’ve tried to convince me to do so many times, because I see the way you long for a dance partner when you ask me to play piano for you.

Maybe I can love you through songs, through touches, through whispers and yells and kisses and soft glances instead of in silence.

Yoongi sighs at the thoughts, gaze drifting from the ceiling to Hoseok who simply stares back.

“Whatcha thinking about, hyung?”

Yoongi smiles and shakes his head.

“Just thinking about…"" How grateful I am that you would want to spend so many lifetimes with me, when even just this one is more than I could ever ask for. “How cool a lot of what you came up with is, that’s all.”

--

In all honesty, Yoongi would gladly live through a hundred more lifetimes of Hoseok. Beautiful, just out of reach, mesmerizing Hoseok.

He would gladly watch Hoseok fall in love and get married, watch him succeed, watch him do absolutely anything in the world. As long as Hoseok were happy, Yoongi would follow, if for no other reason than to be witness to the marvelous, radiant blessing that is Hoseok’s smile, his laugh, his love.

After all, it’s always been the moon’s duty to follow the sun in it’s wake, always admiring, always warmed by the sun’s perpetual glow, but never quite close enough to touch.

Anon asked: Heyy! I'm so happy there's new update for Invisible and Mr. Popular! I'm so excited to read it! Requests are open, right? Can I request an angst scenario where you're dating Jimin, but he's fallen out of love with you, however he feels like he can't break up with you because, idk, maybe you're injured or something? I'm not sure xDD But anyways, you find this out and you end up breaking up with him because you don't want to hold him back. Thanks<33

It was hard for you. You had been told that your life would be in danger if you didn’t take care of yourself. And because you had no time on your hands to look after yourself, you relied on the one person who would do it for you.

He was amazing. He would remind you to take your pills, tuck you in bed when you fell asleep on the couch and control your diet. All with a smile on his face. But you felt the sincerity in it failing. Was it because you were sick that he was like this? Was he falling out of love with you?

Because you loved him.

He had told you a million times over that he loved you too.

But it didn’t seem like it anymore. Actually, it honestly felt like he was only with you to look after you, as if he was holding back his own emotions for your benefit.

It wasn’t beneficial for you at all though.

Your phone rang and your heart froze when you saw the name on the screen.

Jiminie <3

Slowly, you pressed answer.

“Jimin-ah.”

“Baby,” his soothing voice answered. “Are you going to sleep soon?”

Was that genuine concern in his voice? Or was it the phone line playing tricks on you?

“Mhm,” you nodded.

“Don’t forget to take your tablets,” he reminded you.

Tears pricked at the back of your eyes. “T-Thanks Jimin-ah.”

“No problem,” he said and waited a little while, knowing that you were in the process of swallowing your medicine.

You choked back the water, and your tears when you realised how well he knew you.

“Done?” he asked as soon as you had placed your cup down.

“Y-Yeah,” you replied.

“What are you up to?”

“Actually Jimin-ah, I think I need to talk to you… about something,” you said slowly.

You knew he had definitely stopped feeling the way you did a long time ago, and you hated that you were holding him back from finding his happiness.

“I’ll be there in five,” he said before hanging up.

He obviously had no idea what you wanted to talk about. But he was going to come in a heartbeat. Why? Because he cared for you. But he didn’t love you. But he cared. It hurt you to admit it but it had to be stated.

You heard the door unlock and soon his aroma filled the house. Taking a deep breath, you wiped your eyes and stood up, meeting him at the door of your bedroom.

“Y/N-ah? Are you okay? Is anything wrong?” he asked, cupping your cheeks in his palms, looking into your eyes.

His actions stung. His love hurt. His instinctive caring nature pained you.

You slowly took his hands from your face and held his in your hands. He looked down to them and then to you with a questioning gaze.

“Jimin-ah…” you said softly and he smiled, unknowing of what you were about to say.

“Yes baby?”

You winced at that nickname. Were you ever going to hear him call you that again?

“I know,” you said, making him raise an eyebrow. “I know about your feelings, or rather your lack of feelings for me.”

“W-What do you mean?” he stuttered, visibly anxious for your answer.

“I know that you don’t love me anymore,” you said bluntly. This time it was him who winced at you.

“H-How do you know?”

“We’ve been together 5 years,” you found yourself almost shouting, not because you were angry at him, but at yourself, “We were in love for 4 of them, of course I can tell the difference by now.”

“Y/N-ah I-”

“I,” you cut him off, closing your eyes, “think it would just be better if we just broke up.”

“No, Y/N-ah, I can’t do that, you’re-”

“Sick? Disabled? You think I’m at a disadvantage just because I have to take pills every so often and need to take care of my diet? You think I’m so reliant on you that I can’t look after myself?”

You hated yourself for pushing all the blame on him but you had no other choice if you wanted to do this.

“No, Y/N-ah, you know that’s not true,” he said sadly and it physically hurt you to see him like that.

“If not then please, you know I don’t like being the reason you’re holding on to me, when your heart’s not even in it. You know it’s hard for me to be labelled as the ‘girl who can’t even take a hint’. I’ve got the hint Jimin, and I’m taking it.”

The process of emotions Jimin had shown through his face was scaring you. He looked ready to… cry?

“You know I don’t think of you like that Y/N-ah,” Jimin sighed, “Please don’t talk about yourself that way.”

You looked down, “Okay, I won’t. Now that that’s settled, let’s get this done with,” you felt your words cut through the air like ice, but you didn’t even mean the words you were saying.

“Y/N-ah,” Jimin said slowly, taking your hands in his and looking into your eyes. The way his eyes slowly became glossy and red hurt you to look so you shifted your eyes to the floor. “Please tell me you don’t mean it.”

“Why?” you heard yourself say, “Why are you holding on to me when you don’t even love me? We already established that it’s not because of my illness.”

He started blinking rapidly, as if he was afraid to hear the next few words of this conversation.

“No reason?” you said, “If you really have no reason to keep holding on to me, let’s end it, okay?”

He didn’t say anything and, although you didn’t expect anything else, you felt a little hurt.

“Mm?” you said and tried to force a smile on your face, lifting his chin to look at you in your eyes.

The moment a tear dropped from his eye, you lost it. Your fingers started trembling as you leaned up, kissing his cheek and wiping away his tear.

“You’re free,” you whispered, looking to the floor, “free from me.”"

wheewoooweeeeeet you're up for a hell of a ride!! also title taken from tiger jk reset bc i'm unoriginal as fuck

also i read through this like once and probably missed out on errors so let me know if u find any!!

(also this is in lapslock bc yoonmin)

edited 030416, i fixed some errors after rereading them :^)

yoongi is like the feeling you get when you return to bed after a warm shower. it's just like settling down under the covers and binge watching a sappy korean drama till 4am. yoongi is all rough words soft touches.

jimin doesn't know when he fell for yoongi. he decides, it's a multitude of different occasions. when yoongi pulls his sweater over jimin’s frail body when jimin pretends he's asleep, it's one of the times. perhaps loving selflessly is what jimin is best at, falling over and scraping his knees for yoongi; on stage, in the dorms, on the plane; it all adds up, he decides. it all adds up to love. jimin muses, this is when he falls for yoongi’s words.

when yoongi rubs his eyes sleepily and groans out a, “what the fuck, it's 11 in the morning, you shithead. what do you want?”, and yet his voice contains no malice, his words a simple vessel to disguise his bias for jimin. when jimin whines for his favourite yoongi-hyung to come out of bed and try his handmade ddeokbokki, the way yoongi lazily slips his hands into the crook of jimin’s elbow, and lets himself be pulled along to the kitchen is when jimin decides, this is when he falls for yoongi’s demeanour.

on a recent v app broadcast, where the self-dubbed birthday team, jimin and yoongi heads to the kitchen and collects the cake for namjoon’s birthday, jimin almost accidentally sets his hands on fire while testing out the matches. thankfully, they haven't went live yet, but when yoongi slaps the match away from jimin’s hands, into the sink, and wraps his own hands around his’, his lips curved into the letter ‘o’, his eyes widening in surprise and concern, his usual lethargic attitude replaced by soft lectures of “take care of yourself! jesus, i almost had a heart attack, jimin.” jimin only blinks, looking at yoongi through his eyelashes, skin tingling at where yoongi is brushing his thumb over his knuckles. that is when jimin fall in love with yoongi hands.

jimin decides, he fell in love with yoongi, just yoongi, when he lets jimin climb into his bed to sleep, and when he speaks of how his parents disapprove of his choice to pursue music. he decides, he loves yoongi when yoongi scrunches up his nose when jimin boops it (“jiminnie, i will release the photos of you with your hand stuck in the fan if you do it again.” “hyung! i’m sorry”) he decides, he loves yoongi when yoongi lifts up the corner of his blanket for jimin to climb in after a gruelling dance practice and listens to him ramble about the food jin cooked today. (it's too salty.. like him)

falling for yoongi is too easy, jimin thinks.

♡

yoongi thinks, jimin is like a breath of fresh air. yoongi thinks, in his own personal opinion, that jimin is similar to waking up on a crisp autumn morning, where the sun somehow manages to filter in despite the closed blinds, where the sound of bicycle bells and children playing reaches his ears. jimin is like good intentions and eye-smiles bundled up into a human form.

yoongi thinks he really falls for jimin when jimin bounds up to him with a birthday cake, and a brand new leather jacket. when jimin boops his nose with cream-stained fingers and declares min yoongi his eternal fluffy bear, yoongi falls deep.

he falls fast, and he falls hard. falling in love with jimin is just like coming home to an unexpected birthday party (he came back to one), and the happiness when waking up to the first snow day. falling in love with jimin is neither poetic nor how movies depict it, perfect and with a bang, like how fireworks light up the sky on new years day. instead, yoongi feels like he has walked head first into the morning rush hour on the subway, like a student frantically cramming for exams; overwhelmed and struggling for breath.

yoongi can’t help but to fall even harder when jimin chooses yoongi as his ‘favourite hyung’ in a radio interview, and he can’t help but to let the adoration seep into his voice when he lets out a “i’m thinking of writing a song for jiminnie.” back.

yoongi can’t imagine how life as an idol would be without jimin; probably hard and draining (but he chooses not to think about it). when jimin smiles at yoongi from his side of the stage when he catches yoongi’s lingering eyes, yoongi’s heart clenches so hard he thinks it might just burst.

jimin treats yoongi to lamb skewers, because he knows yoongi loves it, and holds his arm tight, winding his (short and stubby, let’s be real,) fingers to thread between yoongi’s calloused and long ones, and pulls yoongi into a candy store, causing yoongi to tumble over and make a rather grand entrance into the store. yoongi thinks that, maybe that trip, was a metaphor for him falling for jimin, because rappers think in well written poems and layered meanings.

yoongi decides, jimin is like a new galaxy, and he is simply a young and curious astronomer, pulled in by the shine of the stars in jimin’s sky.

♡

but as idols would be, and with the glamour and self-control needed to be in the industry, yoongi does not think it is shocking at all when jimin simply smiles at him when he finally musters up the courage to tell jimin how he feels. yoongi knows he is stupid, hoping to maintain a relationship with jimin in such an industry, especially with how Bangtan is on the rise recently, and how the public views gays and lesbians. he expected this, really, but he can’t help the tears that stream down his face when he smiles at jimin. “of course, jimin-ah. i know. i just wanted you to know, too.” he remembers telling jimin, but he doesn’t really know if that’s what really happened when he has been producing for 29 hours straight.

it’s the first in a long time, when no one thinks of dragging yoongi from his studio. he faintly misses the strawberry scent of jimin’s hair and the knuckles of his hands, but who is yoongi to ask for the sky, and everything beyond, when he is a simple producer slash idol, in the harsh city lights of seoul.

♡

jimin thinks it’s laughable how he managed to turn down the one he has been pining after for 3 years, but he lets it be, and drowns himself in dancing, although he keeps seeing a flash of mint hair in the mirror, and when he turns, there’s nothing there. jimin thinks that the tear tracks staining yoongi’s cheek could be piano keys, with the uneven streaks down his face. jimin thinks that maybe, in another lifetime, he can finally drum his fingers on those cheeks.

my first bts fanfic (I'm actually really really nervous to post this, pls be kind to me). I haven't even been in the fandom that long, what am I doing

this is for my dear friend, who got me into k-pop in the first place. thanks for ruining my life (I'm kidding (kind of)). thank you for always being there for me and for forcing me to share your interests with you (jk)

When Jungkook wakes up, it’s with a dry mouth and a pounding headache. He feels as though he hasn’t slept at all, his limbs heavy, but that could also be because Jimin is half on top of him, lightly snoring in his ear. For a moment, he contemplates going back to sleep, but he gets thirstier by the second and the headache certainly doesn’t get better with the noises Jimin’s making.

Carefully, very carefully, so he doesn’t wake up his hyung, he rolls Jimin off of him, and slips out from under the duvet. The cold of the flat hits him instantly and he wraps his arms around himself to preserve some of the warmth.

Slowly, he makes his way to the kitchen, where he fills a glass with tap water, which he instantly downs in one go. He fills another one when Namjoon strolls into the kitchen, looking too awake for how early it is.

Well, half 9 isn’t really that early, except for Jungkook, who just wants to go back to bed. But Namjoon usually isn’t awake at this hour either.

As soon as Namjoon notices Jungkook, he starts grinning.

“Headache?” he asks, and Jungkook can’t help but grimace.

“Good morning to you too, hyung,” he says, instead of answering the question. He doesn’t want to admit that he’s very hungover. He really doesn’t need to be teased by everyone for the rest of the day.

“Ah, there’s no shame in drinking a bit too much.” Namjoon laughs and follows Jungkook into the living room where he immediately lets himself fall onto the sofa, the glass of water still in his hand.

“Even if dancing on the table is,” Namjoon adds, sitting down beside him.

Jungkook freezes. Surely… that didn’t actually happen? At least, he can’t remember doing that.

“Hyung,” he starts, trying not to look too uncomfortable. “I wasn’t that drunk last night.”

Namjoon just laughs again, like he’s remembering exactly how drunk Jungkook actually was. If so, he must’ve done something pretty embarrassing.

“You were flirting with Jimin,” he says, and Jungkook releases a breath he didn’t know he was holding.

“So what,” he replies quietly, a little shy. “He’s my boyfriend.”

He can tell that Namjoon is trying really hard to suppress a particularly loud laugh. What did Jungkook do? Will he have to hide away from humanity for the rest of his life? Leave BTS and become a hermit?

“You asked him if he was single,” Namjoon finally says, no longer able to stay serious, a loud laugh bubbling out of him.

Jungkook simply raises his hands and hides behind them. Honestly, only he would ask his own boyfriend if he was single. Why does he get so forgetful when he’s drunk? He’s so embarrassing, it’s surprising he’s made it so far in life.

“And when he said he wasn’t, you started crying,” Namjoon adds while trying to contain his laughter, as if that makes the situation any better.

Jungkook groans. He should’ve just stayed in bed, preferably for the entire day. But then again, Jimin probably would’ve teased him with this story anyway, so maybe it turned out better this way. At least he knows what will be coming once Jimin wakes up.

As if his thoughts summoned him, Jimin comes shuffling into the living room. The moment he sees Jungkook, his entire face lights up.

“Jungkook-ah,” he exclaims, well, quietly, because judging from his puffy eyes and messy hair, he just woke up. He proceeds to jump onto the sofa, cuddling into Jungkook’s side, who automatically wraps his arm around him and rests his head on Jimin’s mess of hair.

“Morning, hyung,” Jungkook just says. He hopes Jimin also doesn’t remember what happened yesterday, but with his luck, he probably does.

Usually, this would be Namjoon’s cue to make use of the kitchen for a while, but he stays exactly where he is. Probably because he can’t wait to see how Jimin will tease Jungkook for being such a loser when drunk.

Jungkook feigns nonchalance as he drinks the rest of the water and deposits the glass on the coffee table in front of them. He needs to lean forwards a bit, which in turn makes Jimin grumble.

Just when Jungkook leans back again, Jimin suddenly sits up and simply looks at him, while he reaches out and puts one hand on Jungkook’s cheek. Jungkook’s pretty sure he can see the beginning of a grin on his lips and swats Jimin’s hand away. He can see Namjoon pressing a hand to his mouth from the corner of his eye.

“Your eyes look so puffy, Jungkook-ah. Are you okay?” he asks, now unable to suppress the grin.

“Shut up,” Jungkook grumbles and pouts. He does not deserve this. In fact, this is all Jimin’s fault. If Jimin weren’t so... perfect, none of this would’ve happened.

“Did you cry?” Jimin continues to ask, his eyes now getting big, feigning worry.

“Go away, hyung!” This time, Jungkook can’t help but smile as he half-heartedly pushes Jimin away from him, especially when Jimin begins to laugh, bright and beautiful.

This time, Namjoon does leave, while Jimin continues laughing, probably waking up the others with how unabashedly loud he’s being. It takes a few moments for him to calm down enough to see how much Jungkook is blushing out of embarrassment.

“It was really sweet how sad you got when you thought I wasn’t single,” Jimin says, smiling in a way that tells Jungkook he isn’t taking the piss anymore.

“That’s not sweet, that’s embarrassing,” Jungkook mumbles, looking away, but at the same time, he’s still smiling as well. At least Jimin doesn’t think he’s even weirder than he actually is.

“No, it was really cute,” Jimin disagrees, his hand coming up to brush through Jungkook’s hair, which probably looks as much a mess as Jimin’s does. Although he doesn’t look as cute with messy hair as Jimin. To be fair though, Jimin always looks perfect to him, no matter what.

Jimin presses a kiss to the corner of his mouth, soft and warm, and Jungkook’s stomach does a flip. He doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to how much Jimin makes butterflies erupt in his stomach, however cheesy that sounds.

He’s just about to kiss back when Hoseok comes shuffling into the room. His expression immediately brightens when he sees Jimin and Jungkook sit on the sofa. Then he lifts an eyebrow and Jungkook already knows what’s about to happen next.

“New boyfriend, Jimin-ah?”

Jimin just laughs again brightly, while Jungkook grumbles and turns to hide his face in Jimin’s hair. He knows that they will never let this go. They’ll all make jokes about it until their hair turns grey, especially since it seems that everyone witnessed the scene he made.

Jungkook will never drink again.

“Watch where you're going! Oh god, I think my shirt’s ruined.” Jimin hadn't been having the best day. He's heard, “You have to eat and take a break sometimes or your feet will fall off” at least a dozen times in the last few days but he was starting to believe the joke was becoming a serious possibility. His best friend has also been nagging him to come to dinner with his new boyfriend because ""Jimin, he might seen grumpy be he's a sweetheart and i don't want him to take not meeting my best friend personally"", or that's the gist of it at least, Jimin usually zones out after the first few words. And to top it all off, half of his professors had apparently decided to make his life as miserable as possible by putting every single test in the same week. But apparently it can get worse because now he has some failure’s burning caramel hot chocolate all over his shirt.

To be fair his outfit wasn't that impressive in the first place, a loose white tee shirt and black sweatpants. But god dammit, he was comfortable then this asshole fucked it all up. Said asshole stood up from where he had landed after tripping, his mouth open like he was about to say something.

“I am so sor-” he froze when he looked at Jimin’s face. And wow, Jimin didn't know that failures of human beings were allowed to look that pretty. The boy looked around his age yet he was taller, his lilac hair, black triangle earrings, and black jeans made him look intimidating, yet his gray sweater that seemed to be three sizes too big for him was more than enough to cancel that out and make him even more attractive if that was possible. Jimin didn't really have time to consider how intimidating he might have looked though because the boy was still blushing profusely and staring at him like he held the stars in his eyes. Which made him look so cute that Jimin mentally slapped himself for thinking he might have been scared of him in other circumstances.

After a few seconds of them just staring at each other, Jimin coughed lightly to break him out of his trance. If it was possible his blushed went to an even deeper shade of red as he looked away. “Uh, I-I’m sorry, that was completely my fault, I should have been looking where I was going.”

“No, it’s fine I wasn't watching where I was going either.” Jimin counters. His hot chocolate soaked shirt might still be burning him but he wasn't about to let this beautiful human take the blame for it.

“But I ruined your shirt.” the boy points out.

“And I ruined your hot chocolate”

The stranger opened mouth to say something else but Jimin beat him to it,“do you even want me to forgive you?” he says while laughing, “because you're not doing a very good job at convincing me”

“Sorry, I just feel bad. This is like the third time this year,” he muttered, “I’m almost as bad as Namjoon.” Jimin had no clue who Namjoon was but if he was somehow worse than this boy, who had apparently done this before, then he hopes he never has to meet him.

“I'm sorry too,” Jimin insists, then he has an idea that will probably backfire completely but with someone as pretty as this he at least has to try. “At least let me buy you another hot chocolate”

“Do you like dogs?”

Needless to say, Jimin didn't think he would get that as a response, but hey, what does he have to lose. “I-I love dogs,” Jimin really did love them, in fact, he was about to prove his love to an almost complete stranger. He took out his phone which luckily wasn't damaged from the hot chocolate and clicked on some of the pictures of his dog.

“I think I'm in love” the boy said after a few pictures.

“She's super sweet and loves meeting new peop-”

Then all traces of the shy boy were gone as he said “No, i think with you. You offered to buy me hot chocolate then showed me pictures of your dog and that's my kind of flirting.” then he held out his hand, “hi, I’m Kim Taehyung and I'm so sorry for spilling hot chocolate on you but I don't really regret it.”

Jimin was taken back for a moment at the sudden declaration but soon collects his thoughts enough to reach out and shakes the failu- Taehyung’s hand, “Park Jimin, it’s nice to meet your acquaintance,” then he flashed his sunshine smile as Jungkook had so creatively named it. “Does this mean you’ll let me buy you hot chocolate?”

“Park Jimin, did you just ask me on a date? If you did, I say yes,” Jimin mentally high fived himself, “but you're not really in the proper date attire,” Taehyung said, motioning down to the drying stain and baggy sweatpants that Jimin was currently sporting.

Jimin looks down at himself, “That, Kim Taehyung, is a good point. I guess we’ll need to reschedule for another time, but I don't have your phone number? How ever will we get into contact again? My one and only love, my soulmate, slipping through my fingers” he says with a distressed sigh.

When Taehyung laughs, Jimin thinks his heart stopped beating. “This problem of yours seems like quite the unsolvable conflict, Taehyung deadpans as he pulls his phone out of his pocket, “But lucky for you, I may have thought up a genius solution.”

He nudges Jimin in the arm with his phone and whispers, “this is when you take my phone and put your number into it”

Jimin giggles and after sending a text to himself, they finally have each other's phone numbers.

After saying their goodbyes and parting ways, Jimin thinks to himself that this was the best trip to the store ever, even with all of the confused glances he received from everyone else due to the huge smile on his face. On that day, even though he’ll deny it for the rest of his life, Jimin put Kim Taehyung in his phone as “My Soulmate ❤”

“Are you sure about this?” Yes.

“Jimin—there’s a lot, a lot, of things you could be, a lot of things you could do. You’re turning your back on all of that, and for what? For him?” Yes.

The poor signal of the call makes Seokjin’s wavering voice waver even more and it’s all unnerving to Jimin. He knows he’s set on his decision but somehow the pull of Seokjin’s convincing voice is tugging at a small part of him and giving him second thoughts. Is this alright? He’s running away from his parents, running away from his city, from his life, and yes, running away for Min Yoongi. Is all of this alright?

His pulse raises and he feels betrayed that he’s thinking of setting aside Yoongi, he feels betrayed for Yoongi and he knows Yoongi will feel betrayed too if now that they’re minutes away from departure is he having thoughts of cancelling. You can tell me if you don’t want to, we can stop if you don’t want to, Yoongi had told him months ago when they have first talked about the possibility of doing it. He was stone-hard set on the idea from the start and he wanted nothing but to just quickly get it over with but Yoongi wanted him to be just as sure as he is and waited for him for months. All those time and now, now is he hesitating?

He worries on his bottom lip and he transfers the phone to his other hand. A shaky breath escapes him and he had to clutch the device in both hand to make sure his hand won’t give in. “Hyung, I’m—""

“Jiminie?”

Yoongi’s gentle voice pulled him out of his concentration but with a start. Eyes flickering in between Yoongi’s worried ones made him feel so guilty he couldn’t help his brows furrowing and lips thinning. The reaction didn’t go unseen as Yoongi’s frown deepens and he looks at him with the same guilty eyes.

“Jiminie, if you don’t—”

“No, hyung it’s just…”

“Sunshine, you know we don’t have to do this.”

“But we do.”

How else am I going to love you? To be allowed to?

Jimin looks down and without another moment, Yoongi is crouching in front of him, one hand clasping Jimin’s small ones and the other on his knee comfortingly.

“Jiminie, what do you want to do?”

Having heard the question he himself is asking, Jimin’s face contorts and he doesn’t even realize he’s sobbing until Yoongi’s hands come up to cup his cheeks. The elder shushes him comfortingly; his thumb caresses both sides of his face and Jimin feels his chest tightens and more sobs spills out of his lips.

“I want… want to—” Jimin feels no control over his voice and he’s shaking all over, but he pushes all of his strength to voice out what he wants to reply to Yoongi. “I want to dance, I want to hang out with my friends, want to sing—I want to drive a car and play with kids, I want to be accepted by my family, I want to…” He opens his eyes to look at Yoongi and his heart breaks. “I want to be with you, Yoongi-hyung, please… I want to continue loving you.”

“Oh, Minie, come here.” Yoongi pulls him down and into his arms. For a few seconds, he just revels in the warm feeling of Yoongi’s hands rubbing circles on his back. He waits until his sobbing calms down and when it does, he pulls away from Yoongi’s hold to look him in the eyes.

“Yoongi-hyung…” He starts but Yoongi smiles at him and cups his face again, brushing hair strands here and there, silently asking to speak first before Jimin does.

“Jiminie, whatever you want to do, I’ll support you, I’ll be there with you. You know it doesn’t have to be this or that, I can make it this and that. We can, sunshine. If you want to do all those things back at home, we can, it’ll be hard but we can. If you want to do all those things anew somewhere else, we can, but it will still be hard. Wherever we are, it will be hard, less for some things on one and much for the other. Sunshine, you choose which one you can stand the most; you pick.”

Air finally enters his lungs without being painful and he breathes in and out slowly. His heart is still beating hard against his ribs but he feels lighter. Jimin brings his hands up to hold onto Yoongi’s beside his face. His chest tightens for different reasons and he’s still antsy but as Yoongi smiles at him, sure and soft, the smile breaking from his own face makes everything seem just a little bit not as complicated as it all is. He’s daring, newly so and it’s a strange feeling. He used to just hide and escape from his problems and his choices but as he basks in Yoongi’s presence, the man who makes his every bit warm and excited and cozy, he welcomes the feeling of boldness. It’ll be fine. Everything will be fine and everything will work out. And Yoongi will stay just right beside him through it all. It’s fine.

“Let’s go, hyung.”

Only when Jimin’s seated by the window on the bus did he remember that he forgot about Seokjin. He panics as he goes for his phone and groans as he sees the call ended but with a bunch of messages from the man. Nervousness swims in his chest to his fingertips but as he reads out every single text, all of it was replaced with relief and giddiness. The teeth biting on his lips disappear inside as the corner of his lips pull slightly in a small smile. It’ll be fine.

[from: Jin hyung] 2:12am

Ah I see

If that’s what you want, Jimin, if that’s what you really choose

I understand, I’m happy for you.

I’m still worried but I’m sure Yoongi will take good care of the both of you.

Don’t stop being in contact with us though!! >:[

""But you promised me we'd build a hideout!"", she was sitting on the floor of my living room clinging to my leg and pounting for more than half an hour now. I was trying to ignore her and keep chatting with my brother on the computer but the more she did that, the more I felt like picking her up and throwing her out of the balcony. she'd have landed on bushes and we were only on the second floor. she'd wouldn't have died.
"" Yeah, I did. But we were twelve back then, Yerin, it's been ten years, why are you suddenly asking? And where the hell do you think we could do it, huh?"" She just kept staring patiently as if I wasn't yelling at her and treating her like a child. Since she didn't complain, it was even easier for me to keep on acting like a dick.
Never, in all our years of friendship have I apologized to her. Most people were amazed of the fact that we never fought. But that's only because she never got mad at me, she couldn't hold grudges and seemed to not know what it was like to feel wronged. It was like a defensive mechanism that allowed her to annoy the hell out of me without fearing the consequences since anything I said wouldn't have any effect on her.
"" Do you think we can just walk into a forest, choose a tree and start nailing planks on it? "" I pushed her harshly away from my leg by placing my hand on her forehead. she landed on her ass looking slightly shocked and sad. Almost enough to make me feel guilty.
"" hummmm"" she layed on her back, head disspearing under the coffee table. She was only wearing a thin tank top folded up because it was extremely hot that day. No matter where, she didn't mind exposing her body. I could see the last few ribs sculpted clearly under her skin... How could it be healthy to be so thin ? but if I looked further down, I'd meet a not so flat tummy sticking out just a little even though gravity should've caved it in. she was probably counting the chewing gums stuck under the table making sure i didn't add any, which I did.
"" HEEEEEEYYYY, you're nastyyyyyy! I thought I told you to stop doing it! Ewww this one is still moist"" she was making wing movements with her feet in reaction to the sensation of touching the soft wet gum that was in my mouth just an hour ago.
I had my shoes still on, Thick, black and heavy. I lifted one leg, ready to stomp on her weak lady ankle but breathed deeply instead and left to the kitchen.
""I'm gonna make some tea...""
Preparing tea would offer me ten minutes of peace while she could do whatever in the living room. Like shuffling through the channels which was her favourite activity since her mother didn't allow any tv in her home."" Tv makes you dumb"", she said like many others. But I found it hard to believe that her daughter was all that more brilliant than us Tv owners.
""Don't forget the milk Jiminie!"" another thing her mother didn't allow,along with oranges which she'd then eat to an excessive amount in rebelion until she'd get sick and give her mother the pleasure to say the infamous: "" I told you!""
I had some tea that I plucked with my younger brother back in the mountains but it didn't taste all that great. It just made her freak out to drink dried flower juice. She felt healthy thanks to this tea that was completely of natural origin but the 8 cigarettes a day that burned between her lips told another story.
She loved cats , I had three. Their mother gave birth to them on my carpet, No clue why she walked up two floors with her heavy belly but I've been keeping her children alive ever since. I did my best to give them away but who the hell would adopt a black cat? At least they knew where to take their dumps and didn't break too many cups a week. However, I threw their mother out of the balcony after 2 months because she kept shitting on my clothes. I'd never dare to tell Yerin i did that. It would probably become the topic of our very first serious argument.
I walked into her rubbing her head on one of the cat's like some wild child just found in the forest. I was okay when she just liked to walk bare feet in the garden but she upgraded to a full pseudo hippie over the years and it just made me want kick her ribs but my foot landed on the cat's butt instead to stop this awkwardly sensual show I was obliged to witness.
""Don't hurt Link!""
""I told you they don't have names, they all look the same anyway, black and short-legged"", I place the tea can with boiled water on the table before inserting the flowers in. It made her eyes sparkle like an extremely clean spoon, which made me feel like a sorcerer mixing some evil potion. "" Hocus pocus , jesus, make Yerin behave like a decent human after this cup of magical broth"". A black cat jumped on my lap completing the picture. We were sitting on thin cushions, our backs resting on the lower part of my very soft, very cat-attacked couch.
""tea makes me sleepy..."" she had only sipped it a few times and I was ready to call bulshit but her head landed on the table and she was looking up at me sharing confusing thoughts I couldn't exactly follow.
""you should go home, i won't let you spend a second night here or your mom will start planning our wedding"" I got up to pick her stuff and bring it to her but when I looked back she was already laying on the floor, forcefully hugging a kitten and burrying her face in his dirty fur.
""I love baby cat smell..."" How could sleepiness reach someone so quickly? I usually had to toss and turn for a good hour before my eyelids became heavy. ""they aren't babies anymore though, come on, sit up. Let's get you in your shoes."" I pulled her by the biceps but she took the chance to lift her other arm up and let it fall on my back like a guillotine pushing me down to the floor with strength such a small-framed body shouldn't have. She clung to me like a koala:"" I like Jimin smell even more""."

For yoongod.

For my awesome friend yoongod~ For her birthday..or Christmas...or something??
Sorry I almost killed Tae once or twice...<3

Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

The bus you had taken from Daegu was now driving past a green landscape with the ocasional rural home. No matter how many pictures you googled before coming, seeing the rice fields in person was a whole other thing.

Looking out the window was almost like looking out to an eternal sea of green where people worked all day long to grow rice.

The beautiful views were almost enough to convince you that getting on a random bus to God-knows-where, South Korea, was a good idea.

Almost.

The further you got from Daegu the more nervous you became. The landscape became more rural and the accent thicker. Your level of Korean wasn't the best to begin with, dealing with thick accents from the elderly was a nightmare.

Still, you concentrated on the moving fields and the clear sky and took a picture to send to your friends back home. As you were sending it and writing a little message the bus slowly stopped.

Everyone on the bus got off and you followed, whispering a thank you to the driver before looking around your destination.

The bus stop was deserted except for the people who had just gotten off the bus. They walked to either side of the station, probably to their respective homes in the fields.

You sighed and took out a coin from your pocket.

""Heads I go right, tails I go left."" You flipped the coin and cough it in between your hands. You turned you hands again and looked at the coin.

Tails.

You put the coin back in your pocket and took off your backpack for a moment. You took out a straw hat with a pink band, thanking yourself from bringing it even thought you didn't know you were going to need it, and put it on. You do the same with a pair of sunglasses you bought in Seoul, and zipped your backpack up again.

You put it up again on your shoulders and began walking to the left.

You cross many rice fields, all looking generally the same but with different details. Some of them had a small house on the side, probably where the owners lived, and others went on for so long you wondered who take care of them.

Slowly the rice fields disappeared and strawberry farms took their places. The red fruit hung from the rows of bushes adding color to the constant green.

It seemed to be picking season because there was people scattered all over the fields, hunched over the bushes with weaved baskets on the ground.

Most of the workers were elderly who probably retired and have nothing better to do, you conclude. Someone had to keep the farming industry running.

You keep walking along the fields, stopping to take pictures and finally sit down to eat the sandwich you bought earlier in the city in front of one of the strawberry farms.

As you eat the sandwich you look at the landscape around you. It's the middle of the day and there isn't too many people out in the fields, but you spot someone piking strawberrys at the end of a row of bushes.

Unlike all the other workers this guy was young, probably around your age, maybe a little older. His features were sharp and clear even from a distance. His bangs hung a little too low on his face and he had to constantly wipe them to a side in order to see exactly what he's doing; in the process of that he managed to smear dirt on his face everytime.

He was wearing a dirty beige shirt, a pair of loose pants, and suspenders. It didn't actually look like he needed those, but you appreciated the attempt to look like a sterotypical farmer.

He wore a cap which, unfortunately covered his eyes, but the rest of him was enough for you.

The tanned skin shone agaisnt the sun, and, as he moved from bush to bush and picked all the strawberries, his hands moved smoothly and with expertise. Clearly he knew what he was doing.

You stared at him as he continued picking the strawberries, thinking to yourself that that was the best view of the day. You continued eating your lunch, shamelessly watching the mysterious guy picking the strawberries.

Suddenly, as you took a bite of your lunch, the guy looked up from the last of the bushes and spotted you.

He stared at you, you stared back.

It got a little awkward after a good 30 seconds of solid staring at each other but God damn this guy was surprisingly good looking.

His eyes were dark but warm, his cheeks had a light pink tint from the hot temperature, and his lips curled into a ridiculous open mouthed smile.

He waved at you, the basket full of strawberries in his other hand. You stared for a couple of seconds and nervously waved back.

The guy started walking towards you.

Fuck.

You swallowed the piece of sandwhich in your mouth whole, helping yourself with a gulp of water, and brushed your hair with your fingers.

He greeted you with a thick accent and sat next to you.

Kim Taehyung was his name, and he didn't actually live there, he was just helping a family friend during the strawberry picking season. As much as he liked the country side there was nothing but farms and old people there, making it really hard for someone his age to find friends.

He talked a lot, but very enthusiastically.

He also had a lot of questions: Where are you from? Why did you come to Korea? Why Daegu? What kind of tourist goes to the country side? Isn't it hot? Did you want a strawberry? Had you ever been to Seoul? Busan? Incheon? Did you like it here? Did you wanna get dinner with him?

You answered all of his questions to the best of your ability, including the last one to which the answer was definetely yes.

He smiled brightly after hearing your response and spoke in broken English, ""You pretty."" He laughted at himself as you thanked him shyly and covered your face with embarrassment.

There was a comfortable silence for a few seconds. A breeze swept through the valley, relieving you both from the temperature.

Suddenly Taehyung stood up and told you to wait. You did as you were told as he ran down to the house next to the strawberry field and then ran back empty handed.

You quickly gathered all your things and waited for him on the side of the road.

He ran towards you and, without stopping, grabbed your hand and pulled you back to the bus station with him.

""Why- do you- keep-- drinking so much- when you know you're- such a-- lightweight?"" Jungkook grunted as he helped a giggling Jimin get out of the elevator in his apartment complex. They usually took the stairs but seeing how drunk Jimin was now, it was an emergency. ""How are you going to take care of yourself if you're this wasted?""

""That's why you're here, silly!"" Jimin giggled a little louder. ""And don't tell me you're not even at least slightly tipsy, alright? I saw you doing those shots.""

Jungkook rolled his eyes as Jimin leaned against the doorway of his apartment, taking his time and fumbling with the keys which Jungkook suspected was on purpose just to get him riled up.

Jimin was right, though-- he was tipsy. Just a little bit. It was worse when they were at the bar but then he and Jimin had to go home but couldn't drive so they had to walk. The cool breeze seemed to have helped him sober up a bit.

They were drinking to celebrate the engagement between two of their closest friends, Namjoon an Seokjin. They had been together since forever and Namjoon finally gathered up the courage to take their relationship a step forward. It was a happy and interesting night of drinking for everyone, not just for the band of friends but even for the people they didn't know at the bar because Taehyung and Hoseok usually got too noisy and friendly when they were drunk, so they managed to turn a quiet celebration into a half-scale party in just a couple of hours. The party was still in motion, actually, but Jungkook, being more tolerant to alcohol, realized that Jimin had had enough to drink already, judging by the way the older was clinging to him, and needed to go home. They bade their friends goodbye and found themselves drunkenly walking and talking as they got home.

Then Jungkook realized that he had to be the one to tow Jimin into his own room otherwise the elder would wake up sore all over, lying face down on his living room floor.

Nanny McKook at your service, once again. He sighed.

Before Jungkook could snatch it out of his hands, Jimin finally found the right key and they were able to get in. When Jungkook turned to lead Jimin to the sofa, like he always did when he helped drunk Jimin get home, Jimin shook his head and said, ""I wanna sleep on my bed.""

Jungkook huffed out an ""okay"" before trudging them towards Jimin's bedroom. It was easily the most pleasant room in the apartment for Jungkook because it was where you coud practically see Jimin's personality-- clothes strewn on the chair in his room near the mirror, a portable CD player on the floor near the bed, his collection of BIGBANG albums on the shelf near the closet, just to name a few things. They'd been best friends for years already and he knew Jimin was nothing short of organized, except for his clothes.

""Aaahh, thank you, Jungkookieee~"" Jimin cooed as threw himself onto his bed. Jimin continued to shuffle to make himself comfortable, making his shirt ride up in the process. Jungkook's eyes widen in realization that it was his cue to leave, he had to go or else--

""Jungkookie?""

Jungkook's racing heart skipped a beat. ""Yeah?""

""Can't you stay for a while?""

Jimin was already craning his neck in what looked to be an uncomfortable way so Jungkook started making his way to the other side of the bed. But, really, in all honesty, when did he ever say 'no' to Jimin?

Jungkook stopped beside the bed and looked over at Jimin. The latter smiled and patted the space on the bed beside him. ""Come on, get in.""

Reluctantly, Jungkook followed.

It should have been hella awkward, he shouldn't have felt so comfortable where he was, but he did, and he didn't ever want to leave.

When he got into Jimin's bed, Jimin immediately turned to face him and Jungkook did the same. They locked eyes and when Jimin smiled at him again, for the first time that evening, Jungkook returned it.

It felt like all was right with the world.

Then, Jungkook started laughing.

""What are you laughing at?"" Jimin asked as he started laughing as well.

Once Jungkook calmed down, he said, ""Ah, I just feel stupid.""

""Oh yeah?"" Jimin asked, amused. ""Why?""

Jungkook felt like a dam was filling up and he had no idea how to prevent it from spilling over. ""I want to kiss you.""

Jimin's smile dropped, surprise evident on his face. ""Oh.""

""Yeah."" Jungkook rolled onto his back, staring up at the ceiling.

A heartbeat.

""Well..."" started Jimin. ""What's stopping you?""

Jungkook's head snapped in Jimin's direction, their gazes locking onto each other's once again, Jimin's brown eyes looking more and more enticing each passing second until Jungkook couldn't handle it anymore. He turned and faced Jimin once more.

""I want to kiss you... but I want to hug you, too. I want to cuddle with you, I want to make you smile and feel your smile on my lips, I want to breathe the same air you do and be as close to you as physically possible."" With a huff, Jungkook finishes. ""It's driving me nuts.""

Jungkook could see the sparkle in Jimin's eyes as he asked, ""Then why don't you do it?""

""Because I want to do it sober."" Jungkook's heart was already pounding uncomfortably in his chest but he couldn't stop talking. ""That way you won't think I'm only doing it because I'm drunk.""

""Isn't it just because you're drunk?""

In a bold move, Jungkook reached over and cupped the side of Jimin's face, stroking the latter's cheek with his thumb. ""Of course not. I'd never do that to you.""

Jimin's hand reached up to hold Jungkook's hand in place, his head already spinning. He squeezed Jungkook's hand and asked, ""Why not?""

Jungkook paused, searching Jimin's eyes. ""Because I think I'm in love with you. In every way possible. And, to be honest,"" he chuckled, ""if I weren't drunk, I don't think I would have had the guts to tell you that.""

Jimin's grin was so wide it made Jungkook's heart skip another beat and race a little bit faster when he saw Jimin's gaze shifting to his lips. ""It's a good thing we went drinking, then.""

He doesn't know who leaned in first, but he soon found himself wrapping his arm around Jimin's waist, pulling Jimin closer and kissing him the way he's been wanting to for so long. Jungkook's chest felt like it was about to explode and when they broke away, Jungkook was so pleased to see that he wasn't the only one racing to catch his breath.

They smiled at each other and Jungkook thinks he heard Jimin say ""finally"" before he pulled him in for more.

Seemed like repressed sexual tension, requited feelings, and dutch courage was the best combination of all.

Jimin’s bedroom was dusted in a peach hue as the afternoon sun filtered through the blinds. Jimin was sat on his bed while he watched his best friend skip song after song on his indie playlist, trying to find something that completely fit the mood and atmosphere that surrounded them.

The large light pink shirt Yoongi was in looked more rose pink due to the warm sunlight. It hung off his shoulders and drowned his small frame, the rolled up sleeves were still long enough to cover his hands despite the amount of times he rolled and pushed them up. Jimin was in a matching shirt but his was baby blue instead. He sat with his left hand out beside him on the bed to support his weight but his sleeve cuffs were wide and spread out and hid his whole hand, even his short fingertips couldn’t reach the sleeve hem.

When Yoongi was finally satisfied with a song he left Jimin’s somewhat organised desk and turned around, Jimin marvelled at how his friend’s dark hair had lightened as he stood in a stream of direct sunlight, some strands looked more brown than the midnight black it was and Jimin loved the look fully, it made his friend look softer than how he appeared at first glance. His eyes followed Yoongi across the small room until he was sat on the bed with him. They both turned their heads away to focus on the music rather than each other.

Jimin pulled his hands into his lap as he shifted and sat cross legged, the mattress moved with the lack of pressure from his hand and the springs quietly creaked. Eventually they looked at each other again, Jimin glanced at him from under his wavy bangs then slowly lifted his head up. Their eyes (and bodies) always seemed to find and gravitate towards each other in any situation, it was so easy to find each other in a crowd they never had to search hard or for long.

Yoongi’s mouth parted slightly but nothing came out save from a breath that wasn’t heard because of the slow beat of the song that continued to play. He wasn’t sure himself if he was going to actually say something, his mind was up in space somewhere.

A soft dragging sound from material was made by both boys as they shuffled to face each other, Jimin’s white patterned bed sheets got crumpled from their shifting and tiny mounds and valleys of cotton were created. Eye contact was never broken, they stared at each other again with the same neutral expression that was impossible to read.

Jimin didn’t know what was happening but the next thing he knew was that one moment they had been sitting, staring and unmoving and in the next Yoongi was suddenly inching his body forward, closer to him. In confusion and surprise Jimin just leant backwards until he fell onto his back with a quiet thud and a few small bounces, his shirt had exposed his collarbones and the slit in the sleeve cuff finally showed his open palm. Yoongi broke eye contact then, he looked at Jimin’s brown locks that were spread onto the sheets below like the sun’s rays reaching for the Earth.

It wasn’t long until his eyes met the other’s again as he was always pulled back to Jimin by some unknown force. When they were apart there was always a strange itch inside them that wouldn’t end, for a short while they could ease it by distracting themselves in something but the feeling of emptiness would eventually come back, pounding in their chests. Jimin always waited for the itch to come back, at night as he laid in bed and stared at his ceiling he waited and sure enough it would make an appearance every night. As he laid on his bed this time that emptiness and longing didn’t come, instead of looking up at darkness he was staring at Yoongi in the afternoon light, instead of waiting for the itch he couldn’t scratch his heart warmed and blossomed because of his friend being there with him.

Yoongi put his hands on either side of Jimin’s head on the mattress as he hovered above the boy, his own dark hair fell forward to cover parts of his face and the ends of his fringe tickled his eyes. His shirt had slipped down off his right shoulder but he made no move to fix it, it wasn’t much of a problem as he couldn’t bring himself to mind. Jimin couldn’t stop his eyes from trailing down and following how the shirt slipped and exposed soft skin, he blinked slowly and fixed his gaze back to his friend above him.

They stayed like that as the music kept playing, songs started to sound similar and seemed to morph into a symphony while they stared into each other’s eyes to get lost. Without saying a word as if their mouths were sewn shut, their breathing became deeper as they relaxed and went into an almost hypnotic state, transfixed on each other.

With that same neutral expression, they could have hated each other and the whole situation entirely or they could have loved it, yet nothing in their faces gave any hints to how they truly felt to an onlooker. What was known was only between them, no one would understand them and they would never tell.

They blinked slowly and lazily at each other as the afternoon ticked on, no words were exchanged and no contact was made apart from perhaps a slight brush of hands, but there was no need for anything more. When Yoongi got tired from keeping himself up his head leant down more, becoming even closer to Jimin’s face without intention. Jimin hardly reacted save from a slow thick swallow of saliva that deafened only his ears. They were close enough that they felt the hot breath of each other on their skin but their breathing couldn’t be heard.

They valued the peace and aura of each other and the beauty.

He carefully reads the papers one by one, smiling and laughing at the things they have written. ""They're so childish."" He mutters to himself. After a while, he hears a knock on his door. ""Hyung, we're done."" Jimin says as he hands the papers in. He immediately goes out of the room after Yoongi gets a hold on the papers. Yoongi then put the old papers into his drawer and starts looking at the new ones.

Kim Namjoon can't live without:
1. suga

Kim Seokjin can't live without:
1. Min Suga the genius jjang jjang man bbong bbong

Yoongi smiles. He puts the papers onto his bed and starts putting away his works. And as he opens the door and steps out of his room, he says ""You guys better have saved some food for me.""

Author's Note:

Me: *writes a pokemon go fic after it completely died*

Seokjin knows nothing about the game Pokemon Go. Sure he’s heard Jungkook and Taehyung talk about it in passing but he never actually knew what the app or its hype was about. All his life he wasn’t that into pokemon and he was choosing to keep it that way, he wasn’t going to let that app take over his life like it did to everyone else (especially Taehyung and Jungkook).

That quickly changes when Seokjin notices the influx of people outside of his apartment when he looks through the window. In the morning it’s mostly children, in the afternoon it’s a mixture of people of all ages, but at night there’s a huge flock of adults outside staring at their phones and screaming. Seokjin was very concerned and very scared. Did he become famous for something he didn’t know he did like getting out the car or eating that very good chicken he had last week? Did someone see him when he busted his ass at Target trying to get chips? Probably not (he was all alone in that aisle) but Seokjin wanted answers.

He gets his answer a few days later when Jungkook comes over his apartment for food as per usual.

“Oh my god I didn’t know your apartment was a pokegym. I’m not leaving,” Jungkook states as he presses aggressively on his phone.

“A pokewhat?” Seokjin questions. First of all Jungkook never leaves his house anyway but he’s very confused as he’s cutting up meat in the kitchen.

“A pokegym. It’s where people who have the pokemon app go to battle. Whoever wins can gain control over the gym and those on the same team can hold it down with the one in control. Right now team mystic, the weeb team, is in control with a fucking raticate who’s CP level is freaking 696. But not for long I’m about to put some respect on them for team valor.”

“I didn’t understand half of what you said but okay. That’s probably why so many people are always outside.”

“That’s exactly why people are outside.”

Seokjin gets the answer he wanted and he reminded Jungkook that he is indeed a weeb so he should be on team mystic. Jungkook’s retaliation was kicking him in the shin.

So you're telling me I actually have to use my own two legs to walk around and catch pokemon? What do the creators think this is,"" Seokjin says over the phone. He finally caved in to getting the app because of peer pressure and the fact that it's all everyone's talking about at the current moment. The furthest Seokjin got into the game was creating the character and after that he was lost, even when there was instructions.

“Yeah...that’s why it’s pokemon go. It’s not pokemon sit.” Taehyung says.

“You need to pokemon stop.”

“Pokemon shutup.”

There’s a huge silence over the line. Neither of them said a good joke and they don’t know how to continue the conversation without admitting that they both failed miserably.

“...Did...you want to go pokemon hunting with me and Jungkook later on so we could teach you what to do?”

“Yes please,” Seokjin chimes.

“Okay. We usually go out around 9 at night since it’s not that hot outside and there’s not that many little kids around. It gets kind of dangerous though because people can sometimes get robbed at pokestops but don’t let that scare you. This is a safe neighborhood...Bye!” Taehyung ends the call.

Seokjin thinks about uninstalling the damn app.

He doesn’t. Instead he goes out with his fake kids for an evening of pokemon hunting and it actually turned out alright, actually he enjoyed it a lot. Aside from both Taehyung and Jungkook making him the designated driver to drive them to different towns to walk around, they actually caught a lot of pokemon and leveled up a bit. Seokjin is able to get to level 5 in less than an hour and he chooses team Mystic even after the two younger boys screamed at him to “get with the winning team hoe!”. Jungkook and Taehyung jump him in retaliation.

It’s past midnight when Seokjin walks all by himself through one of the fountain trails. Jungkook and Taehyung had ran somewhere else to go fight a gym that was closeby. Seokjin didn’t have that many high CP pokemons yet so he chose to stay behind. As he’s walking down the brightly lit path his phone vibrates. He’s expecting a weedle or a pidgey or another damn rattata when unlocks his phone.

But no, there’s a jigglypuff.

Seokjin screams to himself and quickly tries to catch the cute pink pokemon. It’s his after the 5th attempt to get it to stay in the pokeball. The jigglypuff had a CP of 184, that’s probably why it wasn’t that easy to catch it. But Seokjin knows one thing. This is going to be his strongest pokemon and he was going to nurture it until it’s strong enough to destroy everyone.

“You’re planning to destroy everyone with a fucking jigglypuff named Peach?” Taehyung doesn’t even get the question out before he’s doubled over in laughter. “I have weedles that could take down that pink blob.”

Seokjin makes sure to roll his eyes at the younger before continuing to transfer all his useless pokemon for candies. It’s been a few days since he’d caught the jigglypuff and he made it his mission to make it stronger. He’s been going on walks to hatch eggs and catching pokemon to get the stardust he needed. Right now his cute peach is at a CP of 500, and he has 35 candies for it after trading in all the other jigglypuffs. He’s getting there.

“Talk shit now but when my soon evolved jigglypuff destroys your Geodude then you’re going to be mad.”

“If Pepe ever loses to your jigglypuff then I quit the game to be honest.”

Seokjin halts in his spot when he looks at his phone. The gym at his house has been taken over by team Valor. “Who’s in control of the gym at my house?”

“Jungkook of course. Instinct had control over it but that didn’t sit right with him so he fought,” Taehyung says.

“Typical.”

Not only is Jungkook in control of the gym with his 1700+ Vaporeon named VapeNation but Jungkook has another phone with another pokemon account that he plays on so the other 1500+ Flareon (named DabKing) that’s helping hold the gym down is also his.

“Let’s make an alliance to take down Jungkook. I’m tired of him and he needs to fall.”

“I’m down”

For the first time in history after the constant battles between the two opposing teams, A mystic member and a valor join forces to take down the enemy."

Author's Note:

When I'm sad and numb, I write angsty Yoonmin...
This short stuff is inspired by & titled after the lyrics of this song + thesethreeposts from tumblr.
I hope you'll like it~ ^^

He is in pain, his heart bleeds constantly. It bleeds ink what flows across the paper of his notebook and forms words of lyrics. He already stopped counting the amount of sad love songs he had written in the past four years. His hair is dry because of overdyeing, his heart is dry because of overbleeding.
He wonders when will his heart finally get empty. Too much part of him had left on the papers already but he doesn’t really mind. He doesn’t want to feel.

Living is painful, feeling is unbearable, Yoongi thinks when Jimin kisses the maknae and then smiles at him.

Smooth curves and achingly sweet smiles – that’s Park Jimin, small and soft and caring. Honey skin and prettily sparkling eyes, full of innocence and naivity and kindness. It makes Yoongi sick, it makes him want to throw up. Every movement, every flutter of those long eyelashes is a grim reminder of that he is not able to hate Jimin – he never will –, but can’t not-love him either.
It would be so much easier, being able to hate him. It would be less suffocating.

Jimin kisses Jeongguk again, their tongues are visibly molding together and Yoongi grits his teeth.

You… You don’t deserve him, he wants to scream.

That brat doesn’t know what true, deep emotions are. Jeongguk doesn’t know how to pamper Jimin properly, how to treat him well, how to respect him. He is not thankful for his luck enough, he is not worshipping Jimin’s gloriousness enough, he is not mature for him enough. He is just not enough.
Yoongi has no illusions. He knows that Jimin deserves better than any of them but Jeongguk can make him laugh – and it seems like this ability was enough for an angel to fall from the heavens and choose him.

Jeongguk grabs Jimin’s waist and pulls the older into his lap. He wraps his arms around Jimin’s slender body and the possessiveness in this movement slaps Yoongi in the face.
When Jeongguk hit him in the Run MV it didn’t hurt because it was only acting.
But now, this punch strikes him right in the heart and crushes him inside like cracked glass.

It’s inked on my skin to love, to trust, no fucks to give if all is forgiven I don’t need nobody telling me it’s life and shit… it’s gonna be okay I’m mad as shit, lost as fuck I can’t even think His scent bleached my skin Reshaped my whole heart

Yoongi watches him as he smiles while sleeping. He watches him as he inhales and exhales slowly, quietly. The bland silence blankets Jimin’s delicate figure – while in Yoongi’s ears the world bursts and breaks to the rhythm of the drumming music.

Up and down. Rise and fall.

Jimin’s chest.
The waves of the ocean.
The life.

Up and down. Rise and fall.

This is a never-ending cycle, an eternal torture. Yoongi already knows that he has no chance against Jimin. He has no chance to get rid of his unrequited feelings and fall out of love. Jimin’s first smile for Yoongi was like oxygen, the second one was like sunshine – and the third one was a lost war.

Yoongi is laying on the bottom of the ocean, his heart is heavy with emotions and pins him down. Jimin’s smiles are the only oxygen and sunshine there, under the cold, dark water.

Being in love with Jimin is like heaven and vinegar, and Yoongi is an addict to the taste of heaven.

Can’t need you like water To thirst is a sin Nothing good can come from one thing If one has too much of it I was made for you Saved for you It’s just love just not what we think So I’ll take every hit grow into my scars

There is no air when Jimin is this close.
Jimin sits right next to him and Yoongi tries to breathe but his throat is on fire and his lungs are filled with salty water – the ocean is endless litres of tears.

His body burns when Jeongguk pats Jimin’s thigh – the touch is light, gentle and habitual. It reminds Yoongi that even though Jimin sits closely beside him, Jeongguk is on Jimin’s other side, too. It reminds Yoongi that Jimin is not his.

You… You don’t understand him, Yoongi wants to push Jeongguk away when he starts to tease Jimin with his height. Jimin needs positive words and compliments. Jimin deserves nothing but praises and confirmation about being perfect.

But he has no strength to do something, and seconds later Jimin and the maknae are kissing anyway. Yoongi sighs and looks away. He is falling apart slowly, into sharp, rough splinters what are collapsing under the weigh of newly bought Timberlands. Whenever he is knocked down and left to pick up the pieces of himself, he loses a bit more of himself each time. He fixes all the things Namjoon destroys but not everything can be perfectly, strongly glued back together again.

My heart beats without me I can’t sleep, he drowns me Here comes the ripple effect of too many words I regret Here comes the wave of emotions, we swam in the deep of it Here comes the tidal of worthiness I’m sure of it But they don’t know me like you do

“Hyung,” Jimin says with a bright smile. “Are you okay?”

“Yeah,” he breathes weakly. ’Hyung’… Yoongi is far from okay and his feelings are far from brotherly.

Don’t regret it It made a better me It took everything To give everything I can’t even breathe in It hurts too much…

Jimin caresses Jeongguk’s hand, draws tiny circles with his chubby fingers on the maknae’s milky skin. When he notices Yoongi’s piercing gaze, he rises up his head and smiles at him. His nose crunches up adorably, and Yoongi knows that he lost one of the battles of this perennial war again. The oxygen runs out of his lungs, he is gasping for air and choking on love.

Gasping for air and choking on love

“I love you,” Jeongguk whispers to Jimin. The older boy’s cheeks turn into rosy and his plush lips curl into a wide, dazzling smile.

“I love you,” Yoongi shouts to Jimin but the waves of the infinite ocean between them absorb his broken voice.

Yoongi was never a good swimmer.

The first part of the very long Prelude. Hope my readers can be patient with me and stick with this stupidly long fic till the end!

Min Yoongi, 11 years old

September 1st, 2003

A boy with small dark eyes and glossy black hair sighed deeply. His small frame drooping dramatically as he stopped in front of a solid looking brick wall used as a divider for train platforms nine and ten. He shifted the weight of his black over-sized duffle bag to hang more comfortably from his thin shoulder. No matter how many times his aunt had explained the directions to him that morning, little Min Yoongi just couldn't see how running at a wall would get him anywhere. He glanced at the large old-fashioned clock hanging proudly above the gate. Ten thirty-three. Another sigh escapes his lips. After a quick scan of the crowded station he took off running at the barrier. A whole new train station bustling with wizarding families of varying levels of odd burst into view.

He sighed for the third time that day and squeezed his way towards the bright red train.

*
Yoongi settled himself into an empty carriage, tossing his bag onto the seat across from his own, hoping to deter other passengers from joining him.

""Hey!""

Yoongi was winced.

""Err... Hi.""

His face twisting into a scowl when the guy sat next to him.

""My name is Kim Seokjin, but everyone just calls me Jin."" Smiling hugely, he held out his hand.

Not wanting to be rude, Yoongi shook it briefly. Eyeing him warily.

He had soft brown hair that fell just above his dark almond shaped eyes, his light gray sweater fit him perfectly as if it were tailored just for him.

Yoongi suddenly felt a bit self conscious of his oversized black hoodie and torn jeans.

""Min Yoongi.""

""You a first year?""

Yoongi inwardly groaned, his new and unwanted cabin mate was talkative.

""Yeah.""

""Hmm! This my second year, I'm a Hufflepuff.""

Yoongi stared at him.

""What house do you think you'll be in?""

""Umm... I don't know.""

Jin grinned widely.

*

He was delighted when Jin left to change into his robes (Yoongi following suit as soon as the carriage doors slid shut).

As the train finally pulled to a stop, Yoongi took a deep breath.

It'll be fine.

The first years clambered into little wooden boats along the edge of a huge lake, an ornate lantern hung eerily on the bow of each one.

Yoongi did not enjoy the ride.

He silently cursed the damned boat to hell once off of it.

As a group, they were led to the entrance hall of the Hogwarts castle. Butterflies filled Yoongi's stomach as a friendly, albeit nervous, dark haired man gave a short welcome speech and led them to the Great Hall.

*
""Yoongi Min""

Yoongi didn't miss the curious looks from the table of professors nor did he miss the raised eyebrows and hushed whispers.

""Slytherin!""

*

His aunt chose to send him to Hogwarts because she was certain the Min family's reputation hadn't reached this far.

But of course it had.

Yoongi spent the rest of his days at Hogwarts hearing all kinds of rumors about him and his family.

His mom and dad are in prison.

I heard his parents trained him to use dark magic since he was a baby!

He's probably exiled from Korea, that's why he had to come here...

Some of what was said was true, which made it worse.

*

""Yoongi, your shirt is a mess and your tie is much too loose!"" Jin complained loudly.

""Hmm?"" Yoongi looked down at his attire, his white school shirt was un-tucked and his green and silver tie loose. Robes hanging casually across his small shoulders.

""I always wear it like this."" He mumbled taking a bite out of a rather large croissant.

Jin had flounced over to the Slytherin table during breakfast to sit with Yoongi and had begun to chatter away happily before noticing Yoongi's incomplete uniform.

The Hufflepuff second year snorted and motioned towards his neatly tucked and buttoned shirt, bright yellow tie tied properly and carefully straightened gray vest all under a freshly ironed yellow lined black robe.

""THIS is how you wear your uniform. Not like... That."" He wrinkled his nose at Yoongi's slightly wrinkled shirt.

Yoongi chuckled, half a smile touching the corners of his mouth. He was always amazed that Jin had stayed by his side despite his family's reputation.

""Yes, mom.""

He barely dodged the incoming slap aimed at his head.

*

December 25th, 2003

Yoongi sits alone in the Slytherin common room. His house mates long gone for the holidays.

He snuggled deeper into the dark green velvet of large armchair. Quill in hand, steadily filling up a black notebook with potential lyrics.

Yoongi had always been into music. It helped him relax, something he needed when his parents had been imprisoned and he had gone to live with his father's sister.

His aunt had been supportive of this outlet and bought him whatever he deemed neccesary for music making, including some very expensive muggle equipment (a computer, sound board, etc).

It was a bit lonely without Jin around, but Yoongi was glad he finally got some quiet time so that he could focus and write.

*

""Uuuuugghhh. I hate this stupid class.""

Jin looked up from his unfinished charms essay, black rimmed glasses balancing on the tip of his nose. He pushed the spectacles up and cooed at his younger friend.

""What's a matter, hun?""

Yoongi sighed, ignoring the disgustingly sweet nicknames Jin gave him had already become second nature to him.

""Herbology is a dumb class, why do i need to know about Screechsnaps and Bouncing Bulbs... And when will the knowledge of Honking Daffodils ever be necessary??"" He slumped in his uncomfortable library chair grimacing at his Herbology textbook.

The end of the year tests were looming ever closer and although Yoongi was talented and knowledgeable about spells and potions, his lack of interest in magical plant and fungi left him at a loss in Herbology.

Jin looked at his unfinished essay and gingerly pushed it aside, it would have to wait. Helping a friend was more important to the kind hearted second year.

*

End of June, 2004

Yoongi was swept up into a crushing hug from a very teary Seokjin who, much to Yoongi's dismay, had grown another two centimeters furthering the height difference between them.

""Be sure to write me a whole bunch! Ugh, I'm going to miss you so much...""

""I'll try.""

""Yoongi you better! Don't be lazy!""

""See you, Hyung.""

Yoongi smiled as he left a huffing Seokjin with his parents and made his way out of the train station.

Next year is gonna be fun.

Author's Note:

originally a creative writing assignment that I decided to turn into a yoonmin drabble

Min Yoongi doesn’t go out, or at least he doesn’t go out passed 10pm on a school night. Any night, honestly. He doesn’t spend more time out of the house more than he needs, doesn't make a lot of friends outside of classes, doesn't talk to people unless they’ll benefit him with his studies. In retrospect, Yoongi has a social issue with the rest of his world, his parents would rather him this he thinks, they’ve never complained about seeing him around the house more than they are. He’d most likely want the same, never having to worry if his child were out, worrying about their safety, what they’re doing. Yoongi doesn't have a problem with this arrangement, granted he jitters at the voice of another without him expecting, and clams up when he’s supposed to be presenting in front of the class. His being sheltered has caused him to be mentally afraid of little things. Still with that note, he's never had a desire to change his life.

And yet, Yoongi dreams.

Not, dreams in the way where he thinks about it constantly, hating his life and where he isn't, fantasizing about this dream. More in the sense that the first time he did, it became a recurring dream. He doesn’t understand when — as far as he knows — he doesn’t need anyone. But maybe it’s just because he admires the one in his dream, Park Jimin. Park Jimin, in real life, is actually the drummer to his favorite band, Deafening Silence. A lot of their music consists of quiet music though angry lyrics; Yoongi doesn’t necessarily relate to the lyrics, just enjoys their unique style of music. However, Park Jimin is nothing like the band, he is loud and proud, always on the news for scandals of partying and screaming profanities. But he loves his fans, he’s good-natured, it’s just the partying the public has a problem with. He’s the only one in the group who’s not ashamed of who he is, maybe subconsciously Yoongi wishes to be the same.

Except most of he’s sure of is that he wished he had a friend like Park Jimin, every person who has ever known Park Jimin before he became famous talks of his loyalty, his trusting behavior, how serious he gets. To be that way on the inside, and proud and loud on the outside, Yoongi can only wonder what it’s like to be his friend. (And secretly, even more than just friends.)

In his dream, he isn’t boring old Yoongi, but Min Suga, sometimes Suga. In his dreams, Jimin isn’t a celebrity, he goes to Suga's school, one where the people are nicer, less judgmental, more accepting, and he and Suga rule the school as the mischievous duo. People envy their brother ship, people don’t know if they want to be Suga's friend, or Jimin's friend, or just them in general. In his dream, friendship is easy, talking is easy, but in reality, nothing is easy. In reality, Yoongi knows not a thing about what a friend is, doesn’t know when it’s appropriate to start calling someone a nickname, or curse in front of them.

In his dream, he worries of none of that. Park Jimin slips into the arms of Min Suga like nothing, all trusting and endearing. His smile is the shine on Suga's life, and the dream almost always ends with Jimin telling Suga goodnight, the two shifting from side to side until they walk separate roads to their homes. Each night before Suga goes to bed, he vows to confess, but alas Yoongi awakes in the real world. It's an arrangement he's gotten used to, doesn't expect to change.

Until his birthday — a day in which he usually spends with his parents at dinner, some restaurant where they get the waiters to awkwardly sing him happy birthday — isn’t quite as such. Instead of the routinely dinner and singing and cake and presents, his parents have just left a note on the fridge, apologizing profusely, he guesses by the fifty-plus sorry’s written down all over the note, about how they were called into an untimely though important business meeting. Could be out all night, but they promise to make it up to him, so they say on the note. He can’t deny, he’s a little disappointed, but he spies the cake in the fridge, it’s unfinished with half of it covered in frosting and fruit decorations, though takes it out nonetheless. Removing the saran wrap that is haphazardly tucked where the plate’s edges are, he cuts himself a small piece. it’s a montage of sugar and vanilla cream as soon as he takes a bite; he actually enjoys strawberry but each year he says yes to vanilla flavors. Despite the rush he gets from just a couple of bites, the disappointment has drained his energy, and takes an early rest.

For the first ten minutes, he just stares up at the ceiling, at the way the plaster is barely visible in the dark.

The next ten, he is gone to sleep.

Waking up in the morning, it’s always so cold, always so uncomfortable, with his alarm clock blaring and his mother banging on his door to get his butt out of bed or else he’ll be late for school.

This isn’t that.

The room is at a moderate temperature, and when he rises, he isn’t groggy or sleepy. It’s 6 in the morning, an hour before he ever rises to wake, against his will. He tries to tell himself it’s because he went to bed early, ignores the temperature, eyes don’t register his bedroom until he feels a cold, hard tile on his feet as soon as he rolls out of bed.

He’s never had tiled floors.

He has carpet.

When he looks down, his eyes widen at the sight; the tiles are white. Clean, clear, blinding white with a glorious light sterling line separating each tile. He’s panicking because as soon as his eyes rise from the ground, he notices the walls, all white as well. He turns around to see his bed, covered in white, fluffy blankets and pillows. The posters in his room have not a scratch or dent or fold on them, each one contained in thin, black frames on his wall. Each neatly assorted, pleasing to the eye. As quick as his eyes scan over the posters, he realizes immediately his favorite Deafening Silence poster isn't at all in the assortment.

This isn’t Yoongi's room, this is Suga's room."

Summary for the Chapter:

In which Namjoon walks the kids home on a rainy day.

The rain pours. Unrelenting sheets of shrapnel-like droplets, pitter-pattering on the pavement, petrichor rising up from the cracked sidewalk. Monsoon season in Seoul brings unforgiving, frequent rain showers, and this stormy Sunday night is no different. A soft orange glow weaves between the harsh white glare of headlights and street lamps, spilling from an open door, painting amber onto the cement.

A tan, caramel-colored hand reaches for the handle, fumbles a little, then yanks the door closed, shutting out the humid June air.

Namjoon steps back into the shop, wiping his hand clean of the rain. He pulls the blinds shut, flips the sign to CLOSED, then wanders back into the living room. A small fireplace flickers in the corner; they may be in the heart of Seoul, but damn it if Jin wasn’t going to go all out on decorations. Namjoon casts his eyes fondly over the dainty little potion bottles shoved together on the shelves, the photos on the walls—his boys grinning and gleeful in every single one.

Plants of every kind adorn the room, fresh green scattered everywhere he looks. A large, cozy sofa is shoved against the floor-to-ceiling French window placed there at Jimin’s insistence, saying it was the best place to sit, as the light would come from the window and shine on them.

On the sofa lies two black-haired boys curled together—Taehyun and Hyuka from the bakery down the street. They’d come over ages ago for tea, and, lulled by the warm fireplace and soft chatter of their elders, had fallen asleep. No one had the heart to wake them. Namjoon crouches down beside the sofa and gently cards a hand through Hyuka’s soft locks.

“Hey, Hyuka. It’s time to wake up now. Your dads must be missing you back at the bakery,” he murmurs softly.

Hyuka stirs and scrubs at his eyes with one hand, whining. “But, but- you haven’t even told us about your coven yet! You promised to, remember?” The little boy pouts at Namjoon, doe eyes shining in the firelight, and he has to look away, guilt stabbing him in the chest.

“Come on now, don’t pout at me like that! You’ll give your Namjoon-hyung a heart attack, do you want that, hmm?” He tickles the boy’s ribs, earning a squeal and a wriggle from Hyuka. Taehyun blinks awake sleepily.

“Ah, Taehyun, did you sleep well? It’s 7 pm; time to go, babies. They'll have my head.” Namjoon chuckles then reaches for Taehyun— who is notorious for needing to be carried after a nap—and lifts him up, getting to his feet. He ambles towards the front door, Hyuka trailing after him, and sets his armful of sleepy boy down gently. Fetching a huge umbrella from the rack— really, it’s almost as big as he is, what was Jin thinking?—he opens it and steps into the downpour.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Appa! Ah, really...” Yeonjun hurries over to him, hands dusted with flour, face set in an apologetic grimace. “You didn’t have to come all this way in this weather!” They crouch down and take Taehyun and Hyuka’s hands. “I hope you guys weren’t too much trouble, hmm?”

Namjoon smiles and pats Yeonjun on the shoulder reassuringly. “No, no, it’s alright. They weren’t any trouble at all; we’d love to have them over again.”

Yeonjun grins, then herds the boys into the back towards their living area. Namjoon watches fondly. The Choi coven—Yeonjun’s coven—are new to the area, but they’ve already made quite the name for themselves and their bakery. Witch covens have always existed in Seoul, scattered with faeries, shifters, and the occasional hybrid.

Society never truly opened up to them until the past decade, when the Republic of Magic, or RM, was formed, thus clearing magic users and creatures of their malicious reputation. Now, Namjoon thinks, witches have a much more important role to fill: helping fellow magic-users, protecting humans, and warding off the Old Magic and its users.

His reverie is interrupted by a tinkling bell. The door of the shop opens, and in steps Soobin, one of the coven’s oldest, shaking out his wet hair.

“Ugh, this rain...oh, Namjoon-hyung! Dropped off the kids?” he greets, bowing slightly. Namjoon tuts.

“Really, Soobin-ah, how many times have I told you? Bring an umbrella with you in the monsoon season.” He waves his fingers, and Soobin’s hair and clothes dry instantly, water vapor rising from his brown curls. Soobin smiles sheepishly.

“Sorry, I was delivering a rush order, and completely forgot. Why don’t you sit down for a bit, hyung? You shouldn’t walk home in this weather,” he offers, already walking behind the glass showcase and picking out a dessert.

Namjoon makes his way over to the window seat and sits down, staring out into the rain. He can see his home from here, the warm orange glow illuminating the dark rainy night.

Soobin comes back over to the table, two cups of tea, an ornate teapot, and a plate of toffee cake hovering just behind him. They settle on the wood table gently, and Namjoon nods in thanks.

“You’ve been working on those telekinesis skills, then?” he asks as he reaches for the fragrant jasmine tea. Rose-tinted steam furls from its surface and disperses into tiny flowers in the air: Beomgyu’s signature. Really, these kids— so much progress in so little time!

The younger leans back into his armchair, taking a sip of his tea, ears pink. “Yes, I guess I have—Yeonjun’s also been working on his shifting, not to mention Beom’s gone really far with his water elementalist work. We’re also thinking of teaching the kids some basic sigils; though Hyuka can already make out some of them!”

Namjoon smiles again and pats Soobin’s knee. “Good job. You’re all improving very fast. Who knows, a couple more years and you’ll surpass Seokjin!”

Soobin blushes red and looks away from Namjoon, toward the window. “No, no way! Seokjin-hyung is seriously powerful, and besides, he has a whole coven of talented people by his side,” he protests, but his lips curl into a shy smile. “Anyhow, I have a question, if you don’t mind, hyung.”

His fork halfway into the cake, Namjoon nods. “Of course, go on?”

“Well, it’s more of me asking for advice, really, but, how did your coven come to be? You’re seven of the most powerful magic-users in Seoul, how did you end up coming together...and finding Yeonjun-hyung?”

Namjoon blinks and puts his fork down. “That’s quite a long and heavy story. I’m willing to tell you, but at the price of another cup of this wonderful tea.” He winks at Soobin, who nods fervently, and leans forward to refill Namjoon’s cup.

Leaning back into his chair, Namjoon stares wistfully out the window at his home: their home.

“Alright then. This is how Atelier was founded.”"

Author's Note:

Based off of Yoongi's quote ""I feel like J-Hope has been thinking about too many complicated things lately, I hope he can let loose a bit.""

No one should hate on such a precious man.

It’s no wonder that Hoseok is the shining star within the group. It’s no question that Hoseok is the life of the group and the glue that keeps them working together. It’s no doubt that Hoseok’s smile can remove any worry, any pain, any homesickness from someone’s life in an instant.

Everyone knows this. It isn’t a curious thing.

Jung Hoseok may not be considered the most handsome of idols, but fans would argue that his beauty is his personality, his megawatt smile, and his charming displays of eccentricities. Sure, Seokjin has a better face and Namjoon’s skills are beyond that of Hoseok’s, but Hoseok has amazing qualities of his own. Qualities that the other members can’t compare to.

Hoseok’s stage name isn’t simply a fake title, it’s the truth formulated into five simple letters and a hyphen. The members thought it was silly, even Hoseok himself. But they soon found that to be false, that Hoseok was all that name and more, so much more. He is actually Bangtan’s hope. Physically, mentally, emotionally.

The younger members cling to him like a lifejacket, like a parent, like home. The oldest two rely on his happiness and antics to reign in the youngest members. They rely on him for comfort, for a massage here and there, for control. The leader relies on him to relieve the stress of managing six boys, of producing, of managing schedules and checking what he says, writes, does.

Hoseok is like hot chocolate after shovelling snow in the brisk cold winter wind. The warmth spreading from the tip of your red nose to the ends of your numb toes.

Hoseok’s smile is the sun, the rainbow, and the pot of gold after a spring shower.

Hoseok is the inviting bed after a tough day of work or school.

Hoseok is your coffee in the morning, sweet and powerful.

Hoseok is poetry in motion, fiction in the non-fiction living form.

Yoongi writes about him frequently. About the white set of teeth, about the curves of his eyes, the crinkle of his nose, the dips of his lips, the lines of his cheeks.

Yoongi thinks, knows, that Hoseok is the definition of beautiful.

So he’s perplexed and slightly mortified at the thought of someone hating him.

Yoongi is staring at his phone, at the black words that are too harsh and so untrue. He finds Hoseok through the mirror he’s been set in front of. Hoseok’s face is deadset, too serious, even for his performances. Yoongi knows he’s seen the hateful comments directed towards him, knows that they’re crawling up under his skin and niggling away at his mind.

The members all see it eventually, both the comments and Hoseok’s lack of brilliance surrounding him.

They’re favorite person in the whole world is aching and they have no chance to even approach him for they are pushed onto the stage the very next second.

Hoseok gives his all into his performance.

“I’ll talk to him.” Seokjin offers when they are all situated in the living room, all but Hoseok who feigned exhaustion from his intense performance. Seokjin himself is looking quite worn down, pressed against Namjoon’s side with his head lolled onto the younger’s shoulder.

“You should sleep, you’re beat. I’ll handle it.” Yoongi speaks up, words already forming in his head.

“Make sure he knows how much we love him.” Taehyung says from his spot on the floor. He’s been abnormally quiet since those malicious tweets came out.

“And how important he is to us, to the fans, the real fans.” Jimin adds, concerned about his favorite member.

Yoongi nods, a small smile on his lips because of course he’s going to tell Hoseok that.

He makes his way over to the closed bedroom door. With a light knock, he pushes the door open. Hoseok has his back to him, but Yoongi isn’t deaf, he has incredible hearing actually. The sniffling and choked sob doesn’t go unheard. Hoseok furiously wipes at his face before turning around with the saddest smile Yoongi has ever seen.

“What’s up, Yoongi?” Hoseok offers, his voice weak and trembling. His eyes are shining, but in no way similar to how they always do. Yoongi can practically hear his own heart breaking from within his chest. He makes quick work of the small distance between the two, his hands reaching out to cup Hoseok’s cheeks. He kneels down to look up at Hoseok.

“Jung Hoseok. Listen to what I have to say. I’ll gladly say this a thousand, a million times, but the first time is always the most powerful.” Yoongi says, his voices dangling over the edge of a whisper. Hoseok nods a little, blinking a few tears from his eyes that Yoongi immediately removes with the pads of his soft thumbs.

“We love you, Jung Hoseok. We love you so much that seeing you like this is tearing us apart. It’s tearing me apart and it feels like my heart is bleeding out for you. You are everything we could ever dream of, okay? You are everything anyone could want to be. The members, the fans, the staff, we all love you so dearly.” Hoseok’s bottom lip is quivering and Yoongi feels like someone is choking the air out of him.

“I tried to articulate how I was going to speak to you, how I was going to show you. But there are no words, none, that can fully describe how much meaning you have to me, to Bangtan, to our dear fans. Hoseok, your smile saves people. Your smile inspires people. Your positivity rubs off on others.” Yoongi knows he's spitting out whatever his mouth wants, his mind not taking part in thinking or filtering.

Hoseok is crying more now, which wasn’t Yoongi’s initial plan, but he can see Hoseok’s sparkle returning to his gorgeous eyes.

“Those people mean nothing. We aren’t going to lose you and we could never, ever replace you. We aren’t Bangtan without our Hope.” Hoseok smiles at that, his radiance slowly seeping back into the room.

Yoongi is happy, happier than when he is able to boast about his own produced song, happier than when he gets to take an hour long nap rather than a fifteen minute rest. He’s glad he was able to form words of such an intense emotion.

“Yoongi.” Hoseok whispers. Yoongi smiles, brushing away damp bangs clinging to Hoseok’s forehead. “Thank you. I love you all so much.”

“We know, trust me, we all know.” Hoseok drops down to his knees, engulfing Yoongi into a warm hug. “I love you, Hoseok.”

Hoseok is the cheerful atmosphere of Christmas.

Hoseok is the fluttery feeling of butterflies when your crush smiles at you.

Hoseok is happiness and no one can can tell Bangtan differently."

Jimin thought it was a mistake when the members decided that he room with Yoongi. It was after schedules, when the clocks on their phones were nearing 1AM, that they decided their room setups.

""I'm rooming with Taetae, you guys decide the rest,"" Jeongguk had smiled so widely that his bunny teeth showed, before dragging an equally elated Taehyung with him to the room furthest down the hallway.

Namjoon sleepily groaned, before walking off to the room closest to the front door. Hoseok and Seokjin followed him, Seokjin calling out a sleepy 'We'll sort the rest of this out tomorrow!' which left only Yoongi and Jimin alone in the room. Jimin had thrown a surreptitious glance in Yoongi's direction, only to realise that his red haired hyung was already halfway down the corridor already, long fingers groggily rubbing his nape.

Needless to say, Jimin was worried. Yoongi was one of the quietest people in existence, and sure they were just going to be sleeping in the same room, but Jimin maybe didn't want Yoongi to find out about his need to physical contact whilst sleeping. He had developed this habit over being around the youngest two so often, their giddy personalities lumping skinship together until the line between friendship and solid boy-boy relationships was blurred.

Jimin shuffled to the middle room and peeks around the corner. There is a dead body sprawled in the left bunk. Jimin sees the red hair on one end of the lump, and recognises the mysterious dead body as Yoongi, who is very much alive judging from the soft snoring coming from his figure. Jimin slips into the bunk on the right, which had blue blanket covers, and closes his eyes.

#

It's 3AM. The light from Jimin's phone screen makes it seem like he's being greeted with heaven's shriek of 'die! burn your eyes and see the greater good!' but he can't fall asleep. He kicks off his blankets. Pulls them back up. Turns over onto his stomach. Counts sheep. Pulls his hair. Attempts breathing exercises he learnt from vocal trainer hyung. None of this seems to put Jimin to sleep. A groan sounds from the other bunk. Jimin freezes, not breathing, and realises that he probably woke up the person in the dorm who cherishes his sleep the most, and Jimin's obviously going to be put to hell for this. The angels were a bad omen. He knew his phone screen seemed brighter than usual.

""Jimin..."" croaks a deep voice from across the room. Jimin almost doesn't recognise it at first. After all, it's hard to imagine Yoongi's already deep voice getting any deeper. He sounds like Namjoon. ""Aren't you asleep?""

""No,"" Jimin answers.

A sound which can only be described as a cross between a grunt and one of those extremely sexual moans made when stretching comes from the left bunk, and quite a bit of shuffling later, Yoongi speaks again. Or rather, drawls.
""Jimin, come here.""

Perhaps Yoongi has gone insane. That sounds about right, Jimin thinks. Yoongi, the ever quiet band member whose only displays of affection, although slightly idiotic, are reserved strictly for the camera, and even then, occur in the frequency of Namjoon passionately singing, which was rare. Now quiet, serious Yoongi was asking Jimin to sleep with him, out of his own accord.

Jimin plops down on the bed with a bit more force than intended, and earns himself a stunted exhale from the lump beside him. It's only when he's lying presumably face-to-face with Yoongi that he realises how small the single bed is, and how close he is to the elder. Yoongi's arm drapes itself over Jimin's waist, and Jimin squirms at the unfamiliar feeling of Yoongi's hot breath fanning over his face, though it's not entirely unpleasant as his nose is uncharacteristically cold from lack of sleep anyway, and Yoongi's breath smells like nothing.

""Jimin,"" Yoongi whispers. He hums in response. ""Stop moving. Sleep."" Yoongi punctuates this by slipping Jimin's arm, which was lying awkwardly by his side, over to Yoongi's neck into a slightly more comfortable position, and now it felt like they were both even closer. The contact is comforting, like how Jimin spends time with the maknae line during breaks, and he falls asleep to the sound of Yoongi's steady heartbeat.

#

They wake up a few hours later to Seokjin's voice shrieking ""Jeon Jeongguk!"" and Jimin cracks an eye open, seeing Yoongi's peaceful sleeping face and Jimin remembers last night. He smiles while washing his face, and maybe Yoongi's heart isn't so cold.

It isn't until Jimin finishes dance practice with Hoseok for the day that he sees Yoongi again. It's a simple gesture, Yoongi patting Jimin's back for a job well done - he's never done that before - that it occurs to Jimin that Yoongi obviously knew Jimin liked cuddling in general and last night Yoongi definitely went out of his way to make Jimin fall asleep at the cost of unlike-Yoongi skinship, which means maybe he has a soft spot for him.

Jimin whips his head around but Yoongi just flashes him a grin that no one else sees and leaves, Jimin feeling conflicted over how he feels about Yoongi.

The sky has gone dark, which is when Namjoon decides to sort out the room arrangements. Schedules ended early, today was a loosely packed day and as of now, the time blinks 1106. Everyone has washed up and are sitting together on the linoleum in the empty space that all dorms have, Jeongguk and Taehyung already sitting together, Jeongguk in Taehyung's lap and Taehyung's hands are looped underneath Jeongguk's arms, fingers laced together at the front. Honestly, they look married.

""Okay, so they,"" Namjoon says, pointedly directing his gaze to the two sitting on each other, ""are rooming together."" Jeongguk just beams at him. Namjoon sighs, muttering something incomprehensible under his breath, ""I'm fine with the arrangements from last night, anyone want to change?""

Yoongi, who's lying face down on the floor next to Jimin, nudges his knee and looks up at him, eyelashes fluttering cutely, and Jimin's heart wavers. He shakes his head at the leader. ""This is fine.""
""Okay,"" Namjoon looks at the rest of them. ""Well, I'll be heading off now.""
Everyone files to their assigned rooms afterwards.

""Yoongi hyung?"" Jimin says, looking towards the bunks on either side of the room.
""Yeah, yeah. One sec."" Yoongi shuffles over to Jimin's bunk, and starts pulling it towards his own. Jimin seems to get the message and pushes from the other side. No more words are exchanged, as they flop into the now larger mattress, and as Jimin curls into his hyung's side, he thinks that maybe rooming with Yoongi hyung isn't so bad after all.

Author's Note:

It's uh, not my fault. But I regret nothing? Credits go to @smol-syub on tumblr for the scenario, her blog is a little piece of heaven and you should totally check it out hehe

please enjoy this humble piece ~

They're not entirely sure when it all started. Two weeks ago? A month ago? Maybe even a year? No one really knows, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact date, but the scenes they witness every damn moment they're all reunited make them want to seriously reconsider their observation skills. For all their closeness and the insatiable need to look after each of them, to make sure they're okay and safe and eating enough and living, they've managed to miss this one prominent and very much reoccurring happening. It's funny, how they're constantly on Jungkook's back, telling him to take it easy and not over-work himself like he tends to do, eager to catch up on his hyungs. Funny, how they didn't think much of the way his eyes would drift to their second eldest during those scolding.

""Maybe he wants us to scold yoongi-hyung too?"" Jimin offered, expression heavy with concern as they looked at the absent seat of their little get-together.

This one seat, just at the edge of the outbreak of the sun and centimeters away from the comforting shadows. A peculiar seat, reserved for a peculiar being, cute nose scrunching up in discomfort, from being too cold one minute and being too hot the other. He had seemed content here, so they silently agreed to always leave this seat reserved.

Else they had to face the wrath of a discontent Min Yoongi. His scowl (pout) could make cower (coo) even the toughest men out there.

""Nah."" Jin shakes his head, eyes fleeting over the mooning expression of their youngest with something akin to comprehension dawning on his mind. ""It's something else.""

He’s the first one to notice.

It's in an advanced music class, with few people in it, where none of them save Namjoon and Yoongi have their place but still come nonetheless because time together is precious and it's one of the few times they can see how much Yoongi has actually to say.

He's quiet most of the time because he finds nothing interesting enough for him to intervene, aside from light jabs who're actually poorly veiled concerns. No one calls him on that, they know better.

But, when he does have something to say, he makes sure to do it in that unhurried path of his, slow and drawling, low voice hitting some notes that are like pleasant molten chocolate in one's stomach and drizzling rain for the ears.

Jungkook listens like a starved man, eyes always shining in adoration and attention wholly stolen. It's amusing in the beginning, they don't think much of it — he's the youngest one, after all, bound to fall in this admiration state that they all went through one way or another.

But it's a day, it's a week, it's a month and four months and his stares don’t lessen in intensity. No, no, they escalate to the point none of them can't not see, all of them but Yoongi.

He stares at him with all the love in the world, a small smile tilting his lips and brightening his face. He stares at him without relenting in his attention once, all his senses focused on the other boy, kind of just beaming with happiness because he loves hearing Yoongi speak, he loses himself in everything that is Yoongi and forgets everything around him.

There's nothing but Yoongi in his eyes during those moments, they all began to understand. Waving a hand in front of his face doesn't do much, he's all caught up in the shifting of Yoongi's cat-like eyes, caught up in those small breaks where the boy searches the perfect words, pouts his lips slightly in the way only he does whenever he talks.

And God he looks so taken. Taken in the words and the thoughts of Yoongi's lips, those pouty lips so damn pink, how soft they look, how inviting. And hundreds of times he wonders how it would be to kiss them until—

""Oh shit,"" Taehyung gasps, quickly joined by the others as he smiles widely.

Yoongi looks all kind of lost, as Jungkook's lips fall on his out of nowhere and push. They push until he can only smell and feel Jungkook, until he feels a tongue that isn't his licks and teases and he's suddenly moaning, blushing in a beat because that's how traitorous his skin is, gasps because Jungkook's just so enthusiastic and doesn't let Yoongi breathes for more than a second before he's all over him.

But Jungkook doesn't relent, he's like an over-excited puppy and thrives in Yoongi's shivering under his lips, feels a scorching heat in his stomach because holy fuck this is so much better than he ever dared to dream, Yoongi's already turning into a blushing mess under his hands and his cute brows knit together to show that he's not defenseless.

The thing is, Jungkook is having none of that, none of the false-bravado Yoongi desperately try to display because for sensitive reasons he thinks he can't be emotional.

It's pent-up love and a whole new level of adoration that has him purely ravaging Yoongi's mouth, sucking and licking and biting until the older boy relents under his attack and winds his arms around his sturdy shoulders, a particularly high moan going straight to Jungkook's cock.

Fuck.

""Hum."" The teacher says, but Jungkook and Yoongi are tumbling to the floor and the rare students in the classroom watch them with a mix of horror and arousal.

Mostly arousal.

""I mean, that's pretty hot."" Hoseok pipes up, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. Jimin hums in approval, just feeling fucking happy that Jungkook finally acted on his feelings.

Though... ""He could have done it like, somewhere away from the classroom?""

""We all know he gets turned on by Yoongi-ah's voice,"" Jin points out, sending a pitying look to the teacher that seriously didn’t know what to do with himself anymore.

""What the fuck,"" Namjoon says, eyes wide.

""Well,"" Taehyung chirps happily, a bright boxy smile on his lips as he pulls out a camera. What the fuck is he doing with a camera? ""This is blackmail material right there!""

""What the fuck!""

Yoongi is a whole heck of self-conscious when he starts rambling, days later, because there's a half sweet half heated look boring all over him and it makes him fill fifty shades of, of something.

(He does his best to ignore the leers his friends send him when he comes out of the bathroom completely wrecked, with a smug-looking Jungkook following behind. Those bastards better sleep with an eye open.)

Author's Note:

my first piece goes to the dreamers - my beloved Jimin stans<3

thank you to NotYourNoona for reading in advance and helping me with the title & SJ for your support.❤

Two minutes. You only have two minutes. How could you possibly tell him everything that you feel for him, everything you are thankful for and the extent of your love for him, in such a short space of time? It wasn't nearly enough. You know you could spend the rest of your lifetime in his presence, use every waking second to spill your innermost thoughts that have plagued your mind since you laid eyes upon him and even then, you know it'll never be enough.

The time comes at long last, and you can feel your heart pounding, your breaths sharp, painful, like hands crushing your ribs inside like a tin can. Your head is spinning and you're afraid you'll say the wrong thing, or worse - you'll never get to say what truly lies deep within the hidden craters in your heart. You wish more than anything that it was just the two of you in one room, and no one else. But the idea is also the most frightening for then you'll have his full unyielding attention. Eyes on eyes. Face to face. One wrong move can cost you greatly.

Your pulse is racing, your face getting heated with the beginnings of a fire brewing in the pit of your stomach. If only you could control emotions better, to be at least somewhat presentable as you face him. You blink, shift and suddenly... there he is.

In all his glory, he sits before you. Locks of his hair falling across his forehead making you eager to reach forward to brush them away. To touch. As if to wipe away all his worries. His eyes are kind and sparkling - they take notice of you and the world around you stops. Time quivers as it is forced to come to a standstill to allow this prolonged moment to take its path. His expression changes, to that of heartfelt delight and surprise. It takes almost everything, your every strength, every shard of courage to hold in your tears as you watch his cheeks rise - those welcoming eyes you cherish and wish you could capture for yourself, disappearing as he breaks into smile that steals your breath away.

""Hello, what's your name?""

His voice - subtle and with a raspy edge - echoes through the small space you have between each other. Each word sinking through your skin and worms its way deep down into your soul. It's a light, heartwarming tone and one that soothes your aching heart. He is real. Much too real. And he is here. You love his voice. It suddenly becomes too much, too real. The panic sets in and you can feel your chest heaving like an angry cascade of rocks have just fallen flat onto your lungs. It knocks the air out of them and you find yourself struggling to form words.

He notices at once, the sudden shift of his facial features throwing you off guard as he drops the pen in alarm. The smiles have gone and in place is just signs of distress and deep concern. His eyes widen, you could almost see his pupils enlarging, his jaw tightening as he leans in close that you could feel the heat coming off from his body.

""What's wrong? Are you upset? Are you hurt?""

Questions that feel like fragments of glass piercing through your flesh and digging down to your heart. Each word striking harder than the first until it's unbearable and you could feel your lungs constricting in a dying need to find release. You didn't come here to make him worry. You came to see HIM.

You take a long, shaky deep breath and force your hands to stop fidgeting. The blood rushes to your face and you anxiously break eye contact, peering at him now and again from beneath the shade of your eyelashes. Courage surges within you and you look up at him with fierce determination.

""There is much I wish to say to you Jimin-ah."" A break as you swallow the hard lump in your throat. ""But I'm scared, scared that it's not enough and that I won't be able to say everything that I have always wanted to tell you. Scared I'll never be able to express my feelings with just words.""

You can feel your voice breaking, your eyes burning like two raging infernos. Hands shaking, you clench them into fists in hopes he doesn't notice. How could you possibly be any different from another fan? He must think it, surely. What made your personal feelings so special? How could he possibly think your emotions held greater importance than perhaps the girl he had just seen? The ones he would see, each and every day after? It blinds you momentarily as you wallow within these harrowing thoughts.

But he sees your hurt and struggle. A sharp pain pricks at his heart as he watches your eyes glisten as they are on the brink of tears. Without a moment to spare, he puts both small hands forward, fingers adorned with those silver chunky rings you always wished to see up close, gesturing for you to grab hold.

Your heart stops. Hope. Confusion. Happiness. Wonder. You feel it all as your heart sings with yearning, and you reach forward with both hands and twine your fingers through his. Now palm to palm, skin meets skin, warmth meets warmth, you feel his gentle embrace and let it sink in. His skin, soft yet firm. It sends jolts of irrevocable bursts of happiness deep within you. He holds on tight and your breathing stops, caged within his hold on you and the protective wall he has built sealing the two of you inside. He squeezes like he's afraid to let go. The world comes to a sudden stop.

With a sincere smile, he tilts his head slightly and asks you:

""Tell me, what are the first words that come to your mind when you hear my name?""

You don't even hesitate. ""I love him. I love that person.""

His smile shines bright, affectionate and welcoming like dawn breaking. It feels like someone is showering rainbow dust across your vision. The corners of his eyes crinkle as he looks right at you, eye to eye, breaking through your every barrier and into your soul. That one look steals your every breath away.

Then, with a gentle voice that soothes your heart and fills the empty void that had been tearing you apart inside, he replies.

""Then that is all I needed to hear. Because those words mean everything to me."""

For Jungxhoseok.

I enjoy my sleep. I value it almost as much as I value my patience when dealing with whatever the hell wakes me from my sleep. Like obnoxiously loud banging on my apartment door at three in the morning.

I stumbled out of bed, making my way through my room and to the source of the banging as best as I could in the dark. Which, apparently, wasn't good enough as I stubbed my toe on the hoover I left lying on the ground.

""Fuck"" I muttered, hobbling slightly.

""I'M COMING, DEAR GOD JUST SHUT UP"" I yelled at the continuous knocking. The noise ceased and I muttered a silent thanks.

When I finally got the door open, I was faced with a hysterical, yet surprisingly beautiful boy who looked like he'd just run from the nearest psych ward. I wearily took a step back as words started falling from his mouth.

""Hi you gotta help me I'm Jungkook I lost my cat he's very young I need him back I live next door his name is Catrick I miss him so much I can't find him oh his full name is Neil Catrick Hairris please oh my god what if we never see each other ag-""

Deciding it was way too early for this I cut him off.

""Can you please for the love of all things good just speak slowly"" I groaned.

This seemed to snap him back to reality and he looked me in the eyes, panting softly.

He looked worn out, his brown hair messy, hands fiddling nervously and judging by the label, he had his shirt inside out and back to front. He was a little taller than me, big brown doe eyes burning into mine nervously.

""I'm sorry. My name is Jungkook, I live next door and I can't seem to find my cat so I was wondering if you've seen him? He's grey, short legs a little crazy looking?""

I rubbed my eyes, tiredly trying to recall seeing a cat but being unable to remember one. ""I'm really sorry, I haven't seen him but I hope you find him soon.""

As much as I love talking to hysterical strangers in the middle of the night, I flashed him a quick thumbs up and got ready to close the door when I saw the boys face begin to tremble. Then his nose scrunched, his eyes squinting. Then he started bawling.

I stood, shocked at the crying boy in front of me, not exactly sure how to react when he overstepped the protective threshold of my apartment and planted his head on my shoulder (Which in his case must've taken effort due to his height).

I sighed in defeat. ""I'll help you look around for a while""

The boy- Jungkook, brightened up immediately, sniveling a little before he took my wrist and led me across the hall to his apartment, barely giving me enough time to shut my door.

Once we were inside I could see the mess he must've made looking for his cat along with moving boxes and suitcases. He must be new.

Jungkook fussed around clearing a space on the couch for me, motioning for me to sit down. As I sat, my cushion yelped and a shape darted out from behind it, screeching. I stood up so fast, I stumbled and fell back, conveniently falling into Jungkook and sending him crashing to the ground with me.

I was dazed and forgot where I was for a moment until I heard a small groan coming from under me. I rolled off the poor, slightly disheveled, boy and stood up, offering him a hand.

After he was back on his feet he seemed to remember the situation and his eyes darted, searching for the furry lump which had just shot out from under my cushion.

His gaze landed on a suspicious looking tail, protruding from a discarded cereal box near the middle of the room. Jungkook and I exchanged glances before he slowly began to approach the box and scooped it up, taking care not to spill the contents.

I could see him struggle to keep hold of the box as it shook before a head emerged out the top, the rest of the body following, clambering out slowly and perching on Jungkooks shoulder.

""So I guess that's the cat we were looking for?"" I asked laughing.

""Yeah, this is Neil Catrick Hairris in the fur"" Jungkook smiled, looking at the cat fondly and stroking its head.

""Would you like to hear the back story to his amazing yet pun worthy name?"" he asked, flashing a grin at me.

I thought for a second wanting nothing more than to learn more about this cat and his strange yet endearing owner but I could feel my fatigue creeping in.

""I'd love to, really, but I had an appointment with my bed which was interrupted"" I joked, returning his grin but saw a flash of disappointment cross his face.

""That's a shame maybe next time? I could take you for a coffee? You know for uh finding my cat? Or sitting on him a bit?"" Jungkook was flushing red at this point.

""That sounds great"" I said quickly, as I made my way to the door.

""We'll walk you back"" Jungkook offered, rushing in front of me to open the door. I smiled up at him and we walked in silence until we reached my apartment, which was almost a whole four steps away.

Jungkook thanked my shyly as I turned to open my door, with the key I didn't have.

I panicked.

There was no way for me to get into my apartment but the cat and his stunningly good looking boy were behind me, waiting for me to leave.

I turned to face him, avoiding his eyes.

""Could I um, maybe use your phone for a bit? I may or may not have left all my earthly belongings in my apartment when you kidnapped me"" I laughed awkwardly.

""Oh yeah, of course please"" he rushed his words and immediately started to lead me back to his apartment.

After I'd phoned my landlord and explained my bizarre situation because apparently it was considered rude to wake someone up and ask them to come to your house at four in the morning, I was told I'd have to wait till two o'clock the next day to get my spare key.

I looked at Jungkook, who was eyeing me expectantly.

""So, Neil Catrick Hairris, huh?"""

The soft hum of faint discussions seeped into the living room from the bedrooms, the warm glow of the lamp illuminating Namjoon’s old and worn book. The words, although captivating were slowly moving past his eyes, registering in his sight but not in his mind. He blamed his lack of focus on the languid and soft atmosphere of the dorm, the late night peace that settled in the air. From where he rested on the couch, Namjoon heard the faint, yet steady footfalls he recognized as Jin’s from the hallway. Sure enough, the elder’s weary and distraught form appeared in the living room, his figure drenched in an oversized pink sweatshirt, the hem caught between his nervous fingers. Namjoon sighed, closing the book and studying Jin’s behavior.

“What’s bothering you?” he questioned softly, tired voice melting into the air. Jin’s eyes remained downward as he took a seat in the chair across from Namjoon.

“I just got off the phone with my parents,” he explained and Namjoon recognized the lines of stress interrupting his flawless skin as the ones usually caused by the seemingly impossible expectations he faced. Jin’s efforts to make his parents proud were no secret, they were often his motivation to work hard and keep his strength, yet even after all the success BTS had experienced, he felt it was not enough. “They’re doing it again,” Jin’s exhausted voice spoke again. “The subtle hints, curious questions. I feel like I disappoint them every time they ask if I’ve met someone and I say no.” Namjoon watched Jin’s demeanor, his head resting in his hands, his eyes studying the floor. He knew it wasn’t Jin’s parent’s intent to make him feel this inescapable pressure yet he couldn’t help the surge of resentment that swirled in his gut. All he wanted was to protect Jin from this stress that chilled his warm smile and silenced his beautiful laugh.

“You’re incredibly successful for a twenty-six-year-old. You don’t have to have your personal life figured out,” Namjoon attempted to comfort him.

“I know but I’m twenty-six now and I haven’t even met someone. I don’t know how I’m supposed to, I mean with the tours and comebacks and albums and everything, I have no time. No one understands this life, Joonie.” He looked up at Namjoon, lost and conflicted eyes searching mine for some kind of answer.

Unable to give him the answer that he yearned for, Namjoon softly gestured for him to come closer, softly muttering, “Come here.” Jin obeyed, standing from the chair and settling himself next to Namjoon on the couch, curling up against his chest and resting his head on his shoulder. Namjoon responded warmly, wrapping one arm around Jin’s shoulder and resting his chin on his head.

“For now, we have each other,” Namjoon whispered into Jin’s strawberry scented hair. Although Jin knew he was referring to the rest of the band members as well, he couldn’t help the fondness for Namjoon that settled in his chest. It made him recall Jimin’s words.

“Joonie, do you remember when Jimin was filming us and he said we looked like a married couple?” Namjoon chuckled endearingly at the memory, his fingers unconsciously tracing circles on Jin’s shoulder, making his skin tingle underneath the younger’s touch.

“Yes, he said you were the wife.” Jin snorted softly, remembering the elated sensation he felt at those words.

“I wish we could stay like this forever,” Jin murmured lazily into Namjoon’s chest, forgetting himself and his thoughts. Namjoon smiled into Jin’s hair and pressed a kiss to the top of his head.

Hardly more than an inaudible whisper, Namjoon responded, “I wish I could stay with you forever.” Jin’s breath felt warm against his chest as he shyly exhaled, surprised at Namjoon’s words.

His mind danced in daydreams, imagining the life his parents wished for him, only with Namjoon as his partner. He had been his best friend in times of joy and sadness, the one person whose shoulder had always been there for him to lean on. And Jin remembered the first time Jungkookie cried because he missed his home and the way Namjoon looked at him fearfully, unsure of what to do. Jin recalled the hug that he enveloped Kookie in, the warm reassuring hug that he had felt the youngest relax into. He had looked at Namjoon and signaled with his eyes for him to do the same and Namjoon had shot him an uncertain look yet obeyed him all the same. It was the first moment of true bonding they had shared and Jin remembered the sudden rush of love he had felt for them, the odd protecting instincts he had for Kookie and the endearing and loving ones he had for Namjoon.

Here and now, after everything that had happened, Jin knew the one person he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, the one person who he could never lose, the one person he could not survive life without him by his side, and that person was Namjoon. So Jin sighed into Namjoon’s warm chest, the chest that felt like home whenever he rested his head against it, and said, “I want to stay with you forever.” He could feel Namjoon’s gaze on him as he returned the words, his loving stare suddenly passionate. Jin smiled against the soft fabric of Namjoon’s sweater and continued talking, letting his daydreams slip from his lips.

“We could buy a house out in the country, away from the city and everyone. Everywhere you look, from every window, there would just be rolling green hills and blue skies with puffy clouds. And the kids would love it there, Joonie, they’d love to play amongst the flowers and our little girl would always have some pretty orange and yellow and pink flowers decorating her hair. And the dog would love to run free, the kids following behind, not as fast but trying to keep up. It would be just us and those beautiful green hills.” Jin breathed out dreamily, a longing and yearning for this house and family that never existed.

“Two boys and a girl,” Namjoon said softly, carrying on Jin’s fantasies. “A beautiful lovely girl and two older brothers who love her unconditionally.” Jin smiled sweetly because it’s exactly what he’d pictured all these years, exactly what he wanted. And now he realized, he wanted Namjoon there too.

“Maybe I don’t need to find someone,” Jin spoke softly as an afterthought. “Maybe I already have.”

For Quettaser.

This isn't what you prompted, but it came to me and I hope you like it? Unbeta'ed, written at high speed, so apologies for the mess/sloppiness.

They’re in the restaurant after their day out shopping in Hawaii. It’s late, they’re all exhausted but wired, more than a little tipsy. Yoongi had one of those big drinks with fruit in it, then switched to beers. He’s had a lot of sun and not enough water, he doesn’t want to get too wasted. There are bright lights strung through the trees and everyone is smiling, jostling shoulders, and just - it’s perfect. Completely perfect. He’s filled with good food, some kind of raw fish and rice, tasting like it swam right from the sea into his mouth. Everything tastes a little like the sea here, even the air around him, and it’s a little bit magical.

He gets talking to Jimin, talking about the day they had and the food they ate, showing each other the pictures they took on their phones, when he realizes -- “Hey,” he nudges Namjoon, who just returned from the bar with another beer. “Where’s Hoseokie? Please tell me he isn’t drinking.”

“Nah,” Namjoon says, focused on his phone, barely giving Yoongi a glance. “I heard him order juice at the bar. Just like, a second ago.” He keeps tapping on his phone, oblivious.

“You’re sure?” Yoongi asks, glancing around. He doesn’t see Hoseok anywhere.

Namjoon doesn’t look up, but Yoongi can feel him rolling his eyes. “Yes, he ordered pineapple juice and went off to the bathroom, maybe?”

Fine. Hoseok is an adult, and Yoongi isn’t his mother. If Namjoon heard him order juice, well...he speaks English, he would know. Yoongi shrugs and leans across the table to look at the pictures Jin took of the sunset.

A little while later, Yoongi makes his way to the bathroom at the back of the restaurant. It’s louder back here, dance music pumping through speakers, everyone crowding around him, speaking English too fast for him to catch any individual words. When he finishes and comes back into the crowd, he spots a girl. He only notices her because she looks a little distressed, like she’s looking for someone. She keeps bouncing up on her toes, craning her head through the sea of bodies. She’s pretty, with dark hair and tan skin.

He doesn’t give it a second thought until he passes near her and she stops, looks him up and down, then yelps and grabs his shoulder. Yoongi startles and stops. She keeps looking at...his feet? She doesn’t seem like a fan, doesn’t seem like she recognizes him.

“Hey,” she says. “Are you-----?” She’s speaking English way too fast for Yoongi to catch it. He’s pretty sure she’s not a fan, he can usually tell. She points over to another part of the restaurant.

“Sorry,” Yoongi says, shrugging apologetically. “I don’t speak good English,” he says, as clearly and loudly as he can. He moves to get away, but the girl grabs his arm. Yoongi flinches. He will never, ever get used to how grabby Americans are.

She says something else, but Yoongi only catches the end of it. “----your friend?” She points down at his feet, then starts pulling him through the crowd. Maybe she is a crazy fan? He follows, unsure of what else to do.

The girl leans close to his ear and says, slowly and clearly, “Is. He. Yours?” At first, Yoongi is distracted by her words. He understands each individual word, he’s sure of it, but they make no sense in context. He really wishes Namjoon was here, he--

Oh.

The girl is pointing again, pointing at the dance floor, where there is a semicircle of people holding drinks and cheering. And in the center, sweaty, glowing, grinning from ear to ear, and body-rolling for all he’s worth, is Hoseok. “Yours?” The girl asks again. She looks down and Yoongi realizes that she’s been looking at his peace turtle tattoo. She must have matched him with Hoseok’s.

“Yes,” he says in English. “Friend.” He looks up and Hoseok has his arm wrapped around a bemused-looking ahjussi, explaining about the band and the flight and the show, all in Korean. He’s still body-rolling slightly, his whole body in constant motion.

Hoseok looks radiant, smiling out at the crowd, somehow beaming impossibly brighter when he sees Yoongi. “Min Yoongi-ssi!” he yells, stumbling over nothing and catching himself at the last minute, his drink sloshing over his hand. “Dance with me!”

Whatever he’s drinking may look like pineapple juice, but Yoongi’s willing to put money on there being a little something extra in there. “Jung Hoseok,” he says, trying to channel his grandmother’s most disappointed tone, “you’re a mess.” And he is, his headband slipping off one side of his head, sweat sticking his hair to his face. Every time he stops dancing, he tips to one side precariously. He lurches into Yoongi, tucking his face into his neck, and lets himself sag, dead weight against him. “Good night,” he murmurs sleepily.

“No sleeping,” Yoongi hisses, dragging him toward the front of the restaurant. Hoseok is draped over him, radiating heat, his head still lolling into Yoongi’s neck. Yoongi is going to murder him.

“Sope forever,” Hoseok whispers, patting clumsily at Yoongi’s hat.

“Sope forever until I kill you,” Yoongi agrees.

When he finally gets him back to the table, everyone scrambles out of their seats and Jungkook and Jin rush forward to take Hoseok from him, supporting his weight between them. Jin takes his weight easily on one arm, then uses the other to turn around and smack Namjoon. “Yah, you said he just had pineapple juice!”

“Foreign pineapples,” Hoseok says sadly. He’s nuzzling into Jungkook’s chest. “Very unsafe.”

“I’m guessing what happened,” Yoongi says, shaking out his sore arm, from when Hoseok tried to drag him off, “is that he saw something on the menu, said ‘pineapple juice,’ then kept nodding and saying yes when the bartender told him what else was in the drink.”

“I love you guys,” Hoseok says, seriously. “Even you, my little Jungkookie who grew up to be a giant.”

“Thanks, hyung,” Jungkook says. “Can I borrow your new sound mixer?”

They drag him out, Jin and Jungkook arguing over who has the heavier side the whole time. Namjoon is lecturing a now passed-out Hoseok about proper behavior and representing Korea. Jimin is laughing too hard to get a good picture, curling up and giggling into Taehyung, who has one arm slung around him and one arm extended, taking pictures of the moonlight filtering through the palm trees.

Yoongi smiles, the warmth in his chest extending through his whole body, out into the cool Hawaiian night. They’re a bunch of idiots, that’s for sure, but at least they’re his idiots.

You were walking through the park with you hands in your pockets trying to keep them away from the chill in the air when suddenly someone bumped into you and you both fell to the ground. ""Ow hey watch where you're going."" you said as you stood up and offered the stranger a hand. ""S-sorry, are you okay?"" they said looking around scared as if they were being watched. ""Yeah I'm fine are you?"" the hooded figure nodded. You tried looking at their face but they were wearing a facemask.

Suddenly a rush of people started coming your way and you saw the person in the hoodie tense. Before they could get away you were surrounded by screaming girls yelling for the person and trying to their attention. You heard a few things through the screams, including the name Jimin and when you looked back you took a closer look and realized they were right this was Jimin from BTS.

You now knew who he was and tried to get away but unfortunately that's when the fans started noticing you and some of the screaming died down. This meant one of two things you would either have to run away just like Jimin had been doing earlier or you would have to deal with all the fans here. Looking around at the sheer amount of people you decided your best bet was to run especially since they already had cameras and you could hear the whispers they were exchanging and knew rumors would soon spread if they hadn't started already.

Taking your chance you grabbed Jimin's hand and made a run for a small opening in the crowd of fans. Pushing through you pulled him with you and ran, at first he didn't register that you were both running away but then he picked up his pace and you let him go as you both ran down the street as fast as you could from the massive crowd behind you.

After 10 minutes of running you were both breathing heavily and you hoped that you could soon get a break. Within a few seconds Jimin pulled you inside of a building and you both ran to the security guard who took one look at Jimin and let you both in. You could hear the fans screaming outside the glass doors and you were glad to be away from them. Along the way Jimins hood had fallen off his head and you were finally certain it was him. When he looked back at you and took off his facemask smiling although you could tell he was a little apprehensive.

""Thank you for that back there. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't helped me get away."" he said still trying to catch his breath. You nodded and sat against the wall your legs burning from the run. ""Does that happen often?"" you asked closing your eyes and leaning your head back against the wall. ""Not often but it can happen. I'm Jimin by the way, what's your name?"" he asked trying to be polite. ""Y/n and I know who you are it was hard not to know since they were all screaming your name."" You said with a chuckle before you heard footsteps running towards you two.

At first you thought a fan had snuck in but when you turned to check, it was just another member from BTS. Jin was standing In front of you both only looking at Jimin once before he disappeared through a door across the hall coming back with two big glasses of water. ""Here, the security told manager that you and a second person came running through the doors being chased."" he said addressing Jimin before turning to you. ""I'm guessing that was you, here. You both look exhausted."" he said as he handed you both the glasses of water. You drank yours so quickly you gave yourself the hiccups for a bit.

""Thank you."" was all you said before you stood back up and dusted your pants. ""I should get going. I wish I could have met you both under better circumstances."" you said bowing before turning to leave. Jimin grabbed your wrist stopping you. ""Y/n, you might want to take the back way I don't think they're going to leave any time soon."" he said before handing you a fresh facemask Jin had brought with him and taking off his hoodie before handing it to you. ""Here you could use it. They know your face now and what you're wearing so be careful."" he said and you nodded and put on the hoodie and facemask.

You missed the appreciative look he gave you before he shook his head clear of any wayward thoughts. ""Thank you again. Which way would I go to leave?"" you asked before he pointed down the hall and told you to go straight down and follow the signs from there. You faced in the direction he gave and sighed knowing it would be a long way home.

A few days later you were in your house looking at the hoodie and face mask he had given you wondering how you would return it. Ever since that day there had been rumors that Jimin was dating someone and although they hadn't posted any pictures of you, you knew they were out there. Sighing you decided it would be best to return his items quickly and get it over with.

Once you were inside Big Hit you thought you would have trouble getting in but you were surprised when the front desk secretary let you in saying they had orders to let you in if you came back. You shrugged thinking it was because Jimin wanted his stuff back and headed in the direction the receptionist said to go. When you arrived you saw BTS practicing before they took a break. When Jimin noticed you he gave his signature smile and you couldn't help giving him your own. He came up to you and you quickly pushed his hoodie and face mask into his arms. ""I washed it and thought you might want it back."" you said a bit nervous before turning to leave.

Before you could Jimin spoke up and stopped you ""y/n?"" He said a little shy this time. You turned around and he searched around his pockets before he handed you a small paper and basically ran away back to practice with his members who were patting his back and glancing at you occasionally. When you were back home you opened the paper and saw the note had a number and a few scentences written after.

'Call me you seem like a nice girl and I would like to get to know you better. Like you said I wish we would have met under different circumstances.' You smiled and the note and saved the number on your phone. You didn't know what this would lead to but you would definitely not waste this oportunity"

Title: Lips of an Angel

""Yoongi! Yoongi hyung!""

Yoongi was jolted out of his sleep at the voice, sharp shivers coursed down his spine, beads of sweat on his forehead. His attention was brought to the loud knocks at his apartment door.

""Yoongi hyung please,"" called that sweet familiar voice once again, ascended with another scandalous knocks outside. Without much thinking, he groggily stepped out of his bed and trudged down his way to the source of the ruckus.

Plump, soft lips crashed his own the second he opened the door. It took him moments to blink the shock and to register what's happening. Without even looking at his perpetrator, Yoongi could still absolutely recognized the owner of those unforgettable lips. Those lips, those fucking soft, sweet plump lips that he's been missing for the past six months. Afraid of the building familiar hot sensation and current tempting situation, Yoongi took all his self-control and courage to push his angel away.

""Fuck!"" Yoongi struggled maintaining his balance, resulting for his ass to kiss the floor. ""Yoongi,"" more strings of internal curses flooded his brain tempting to flow out his way. But then when he looked up, he was met with red, puffy crying eyes of his ex. ""Why are you here Jimin?"" whispered Yoongi, confusion, hurt, and nervousness laced his voice. He could also feel his heart, forcing its way out of his chest.

""Yoongi, I-I miss you!""

Yoongi's ears were drowned by the quivering stutter. He winced twice on the pain and sorrow of Jimin's voice. His own pain tripling his clouded mind. ""yoongi hyung please, I'm begging you. Take me back. Take me back for the last time and I'll make it right. I'll love you better just take me back,"" how he wished to hear those desperate words a few months ago. Oh my god, if only those were uttered when he was desperate himself.

Sleep long forgotten, he looked at Jimin, tracing his lithe face, crescent puffy eyes, lovely nose and plump as ever lips with his wavering eyes. Why was he here now when he's already almost moved on? Why was Jimin fucking his emotions when he most doesn't need it? Why was he feeling everything like it was all just yesterday's quarrel?

Jimin's shoulders shook harder than they were a while ago, hearing no response from Yoongi. His sight blurred, but he tried again. This time he shouted all his desperation on his knees. ""Ssh, Hoseok's sleeping. We can't be too loud please,"" Yoongi was quite amazed that he had maintained his voice flat and straight. He silently patted his back for actually having the consciousness of thinking about his sleeping boyfriend in his room, directly not too far from the door of his small apartment.

Jimin hiccuped, feeling more slumped as he registered Yoongi's new boyfriend's invisible presence. Before he could say another word, the elder beat him to it. ""You should go back to Jungkook. I bet he doesn't have a clue about you being here while talking to me so late in the fuck ass time yeah?""

""It's fine-""

""No."" Yoongi cut him sharp and stinging. A humorless laugh slipped his lips before looking straight to Jimin's eyes for the second time tonight. ""It's not fine and you know it. Please go home,"" he had almost turned back when Jimin caught his left elbow.

""Yoongi! Yoongi hyung I still love you, please, just-"" Yoongi shut his eyes tight before looking back to the younger. Yoongi realized for a split seconds how it felt really good to hear Jimin's voice saying his name. Coming from the lips of an angel hearing those words it makes him weak.

""Yoongi hyung?"" the voice of his sunshine rang out from the closed bedroom door behind him. ""Yoongi?"" another call from Hoseok and he snapped into reality. He smiled sadly and looked behind him. Then he was reminded of Hoseok's smile that brings sunshine to his life for the past years now. Hearing his name from those heart-shaped lips of his long-time best friend and now lover of two months, he made his resolved and face Jimin for the last time.

""I never want to say goodbye-""

""Then don't,"" Jimin cut, lips trembling from too much crying. He held on to the older's wrist with begging, swollen eyes. He tried smiling at Yoongi but the latter just softened his gazed at him and gently freed his wrist from the younger's hand. He shook his head and timidly smiled to Jimin, pure sadness and empathy on his face.

'I never want to say goodbye, but you made it hard to be faithful with those lips of an angel. My sunshine is waiting for me and so is your bunny to you Jiminie. Good night,"" Yoongi patted Jimin's left cheek lightly and stepped back. He gently closed the door behind him and rest his weight on his back on the door frame.

""Yoongi,"" Hoseok called from the now opened bedroom door with an overflowing compassion and understanding etched on his face. His eyes reflected affection and encouragement as he opened his arms, signaling the elder for a hug. ""I love you,"" he assured Yoongi as he took his embrace and the latter beamed his gummy smile at him.

""I know, sunshine,"" he softly pecked Hoseok's nose and coaxed him back to bed.

Yeah, Yoongi won't deny that maybe he had sometimes wished Hoseok was Jimin. He may or may not have dreamt of Jimin as well. He may have guessed that he hasn't really moved on. But who cares? Hoseok is there, holding him close without questions and conditions at all. Hoseok is also an angel. He might be an even better angel for that matter. Indeed, he is a different angel. His lips calling Yoongi are anything but unfaithful. Loving him harder than Jimin wouldn't be that difficult, Yoongi thought as Hoseok kisses him on the bed. Sparks flew and he knew that he loves him now and will love him better.

Two different lips from two different angels. Yoongi is now sure that Hoseok's are the best. He looked at those heart-shaped lips of an angel and pecked it once more before he laid himself to cuddle with the latter. They wished each other goodnight with silent promises of being faithful and assurances of a better future.

jin sits alone in his and namjoon’s shared hotel room, watching the waves crash against the shore outside of his window. he’s the only one still indoors. the trip to hawaii had made him realize a few things.

he knew he wasn’t the most popular in his band, of course not. not when there were members as attractive and talented as taehyung or jungkook, but did people really think so little of him? he’d witnessed what hoseok had gone through when the ‘#kickjhopeoutofbts’ tag went around. he witnessed how stressed he’d gotten and how really the only one who managed to cheer him back up was yoongi.

he’d seen it all, seen the emotional turmoil and depression. he never thought he’d go through it. he knew he didn’t get the most lines, and he knew he’d passed up many opportunities to be in this group, where he barely got to sing at all. he knew he’d gotten his acting degree and yet stayed in music.

he knew it all. but he didn’t think it would make him feel this way, so torn. he loved bangtan, he loved them all so much. they were his children, as some fans might say. and of course he’d had feelings for a certain leader since forever ago, but would it really be so bad to leave it behind if it meant he could pursue his dream?

dream.

of course jin considered this his dream. but it was so little, so much less than what he’d hoped for. when he first started out, he’d imagined long lines and voice strain. what he got was less than a minute of words in each song, and nothing to really show he was a singer other than his familiar appearance.

it hurt, to be honest.

would it go away if he left? if he decided to join vixx or exo, would he be happier? would he be okay, leaving everything behind to start something new? was not receiving lines that big of a deal? something in the back of mind nagged at him again, saying, “it’s not only the lines.” and of course it wasn’t.

he’d gotten horrible treatment from bighit, of course. but they were his bosses, didn’t every boyband get pestered a bit? it wasn’t the first time, and certainly wouldn’t be the last. so was it a reason to leave bts? he sighed, and shook his head of the terrible thoughts.

“i’m not leaving.” he said, determined, but his face fell when he heard the door open and the familiar laughs of his friends. “but, maybe they’d be better off without me..” he murmured, breaking his gaze from the water and plastering his best smile to meet the rest of his bandmates.

“welcome home!” he cheered, walking out of his room and hugging his arms tightly to his chest. as if he was defending something. perhaps his thoughts. “hii!” taehyung cheered, his cheeks tinted pink. jimin and hoseok’s were a darker shade, as well. had they gotten drunk?

“we,” namjoon sighed when hoseok stumbled and rammbed into his side. “we went out for a few drinks, and these three seemed to forget they’re lightweights.” jin nodded and laughed softly. “of course. well, let’s get them some water and have them sleep. looks like we won’t be filming much tomorrow.”

namjoon nodded, and started to speak but was cut off by a loud protest from yoongi. “stoopp hoseok! you need to get some sleep.” jin glanced at the couple, the younger of which was pushed painfully hard against yoongi’s poor chest. “agh, maybe just get hoseok in bed. water will still be here in the morning.”

by the time everyone had settled down, it was already quite late, and past time to get sleep, if they wanted to be prepared for the coming day. alone in their room, namjoon was already fast asleep beside him. “hah, how would you feel if i left, joon-ah?” jin mumbled silently to the air. he didn’t mean for namjoon to hear, but the rustling of the younger man signaled he had.

“huh? leave..?” namjoon asked, sitting up and pulling jin into a side-hug. “oh, it’s nothing..” “kim seokjin, you’re always willing to help me. what’s wrong?” jin shrugged and returned the rapper’s hug. “ah.. well.. i don’t know. i was thinking about line distribution and stuff and.. the band wouldn’t suffer a loss if i left would it?” he looked up with a sad smile and glossy eyes.

namjoon shook his head furiously. “yes we would! jin, what are you thinking?” jin shrugged and mumbled, “what if i pursued acting?” the younger cocked his head, “i’d support you in anything, hyung, but i wish you would stay with us.. with me.” jin nodded, “yes. i wouldn’t leave. it was just something i thought of.”

“jin, are you crying?” before the elder had realized, salty tears had started dripping down his cheeks. “oh, i am. i’m sorry, namjoon-ah, go back to bed.” namjoon shook his head again and turned to sit in jin’s lap, pulling him tightly to his chest.

“you’re perfect, kim seokjin. anyone who thinks otherwise is completely incorrect.” jin huffs, “you’re heavy.” he mutters, and turns the other way. “....thank you joonie.” namjoon smiles and presses an innocent kiss to his cheek, before sliding off of him and laying down. “get some sleep, hyung.”

..extra..

the door slams open and a hammered taehyung points accusingly at jin, “you’re sobbing!” jimin and pops up behind his boyfriend and nods along, “jinnie hyung!” and just like that the rest of the group are in the doorway accusing namjoon of making jin cry.

“mean old leader! making my jinnie cry!” taehyung says defensively, jumping onto the bed and holding the older tight. yoongi and jungkook still stand in the door, amused, as hoseok and jimin join tae on the bed. “meanie!” hoseok yells at namjoon, sticking out his tongue and crawling on top of the ever growing pile jin is crushed under.

“i- it wasn-” namjoon’s claims are drowned in the yelling of jimin, taehyung, and hoseok. his objections are no match for them. “guys!” jin tries to escape but is continued to be held down. ""it’ll be okay!!” taehyung pouts, and then there is really nothing anyone can do to get the three rowdy men off of him.

yoongi tries to drag hoseok away, but fails, instead being dragged himself onto the bed. jungkook is the last resort, and starts to leave, yet is persuaded to help by namjoon and yoongi’s whines. as expected, he is pulled onto the bed as well.

long story short, jin knows where he belongs, and enjoys sleeping with six other fully grown men in a queen sized bed as much as one possibly could.

he loves his friends, and he wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.

Author's Note:

Thank you to my wonderful beta Bunbungee. Always ready to go over my work and give me feedback.

I highly recommend listening to this in order to relax into the same mood Jimin is in.

Warning: apparently it makes you want to crawl in bed and cocoon.

There was a silent knock on the door, something barely noticeable. If Jimin wasn’t trying to do some resemblance of mediation on his bed, he might not have heard it. It was unsure and he was preparing himself for what was coming next.

“Hmmmm, come in.” He didn’t need to raise his voice, the walls were thin in the apartment.

“Hey Jimin, am I bothering you?” It was Hoseok’s voice.

Jimin was still sitting in meditation position, his back against the wall, eyes closed. “No, what’s up.” His voice was low and steady and patient.

“Can you please talk to Yoongi again?” The request was made with all care and tact in the world, so much uncertainty to avoid any bother that accompanied the demand. “What happened?”

“He’s back to being quite negative about everything, I think it’s really getting to Taehyung and it’s making Jungkook feisty again.” Hoseok tried to explain the situation without making it sound like it was anything extreme, but Jimin knew that if this escalated further it could get bad.

“He’s trying, you know.”

“Yes, I know.” Hoseok built in a short pause “I’m only asking because we’re planned to appear on a variety show tomorrow, I don’t want it to affect our performance.” Jimin knew exactly what Hoseok was talking about, if nobody was in the right mood, they couldn’t perform on the shows like they always do. Showing off their friendship, like zero tension existed. They knew how to act through it, but when the mindset was off, it was harder to come across spontaneous. Having fans scrutinise everything, they needed to bring their A game without default.

The room remained silent, Jimin knew that Hoseok was standing in the middle of the bedroom. Awkwardly. Waiting for an answer. It had taken him a lot of courage to ask Jimin, and he didn’t like doing it.

“I’ll talk to him.” With that, the tension in the room was relieved, Hoseok mumbled some thank yous and hurried out of the room.

Jimin continued his pseudo meditation, but he knew sooner or later he’d have to go and sort things out. Putting things off wasn’t something he liked doing.

With one last strong exhale through his nose he slowly opened his eyes, grabbed his hoodie and set off to the studio.

Jimin:

You’re at the recording studio?

Yoongi:

Yeah, why?

Jimin:

Should be there in 15, let’s talk then.

Yoongi:

I fucked up again, didn’t I?

Jimin put his phone in his pocket and sat back in the cab. Deep down he’d hoped not to have to see the office on a Sunday, but he knew that he usually ended up there when Yoongi was working anyway.

He stepped out of the cab, and greeted the security guard at the entrance of the building. “Hey, how’s it going? Did you watch the Giants yesterday?” Jimin didn’t know much about the guard, only that he was from Busan as well and loved baseball. It’s not something he particularly cared for, but he kept an eye on it for occasional small chat. Made him feel like he wasn’t taking the job for granted.

“Yes, not the best match of the season. Yoongi’s not come out since he arrived this morning.” The guard had understood the politeness in Jimin’s questions and had never gone further than giving brief answers and an update on Yoongi’s workaholism.

“Thanks, have a great evening.” Jimin said after the elevator had dinged and the doors had opened.

Jimin went for the couch where he took off his shoes so he could lie in it. Yoongi had seen him come in, but continued working till he was done. Jimin closed his eyes and enjoyed the silence occasionally disturbed by Yoongi’s mouse clicks.

It was calming. All the sounds, the feelings, the sensations were muted for Jimin today. Something peaceful had invaded Jimin overnight and when he woke up he basked in the stillness of the world.

He was in a light sleep when he felt Yoongi try to settle on the couch, putting Jimin’s feet in his lap. “I don’t know what happened, Hoseok didn’t say. Only that Taehyung might be hurt and it’s making the maknae too feisty again.” Yoongi didn’t say anything, he was softly rubbing Jimin’s socked feet.

“I’ll apologise when I get home. I’m sorry you had to come out for this.”

“It’s okay, I’m glad to see you. Everything good?” Jimin gently opened his eyes to scrutinise Yoongi’s expression. They’d gone over this many times. Jimin was always the buffer between the group and Yoongi when Yoongi got bratty. They’d talked about it, they’d had fights over it. Now they’d settled, they knew it was a sore issue. Yoongi could lash out, it was never done maliciously, but it affected them as a group. Pressure got to them in different ways.

Once Yoongi had finally understood the strain his actions put on Jimin, he’d started being more earnest in his attempt to reign in his attitude. He knew he could flare up at times, that it took the upper hand. However, before he didn’t care as much about fixing his habits, or finding a way to control them better.

Now that another person was involved, he tried to not let the stress get to him as much anymore. Some breathing techniques and some meditation sessions had helped him clear his mind of perceptions that were only true in his mind. He was trying to reset, but it wasn’t going to be miraculous. It was going to take a long time to get rid of old habits, old perceptions, old paranoia.

“Did you meditate this morning?” When no answer ensued “You shouldn’t skip it, let’s do it together tomorrow.”

After more silence Jimin lightly kicked Yoongi to grab his attention. He opened his arms, “Come here.” He shifted to make enough space so that Yoongi could lie down next to him. With his ear on Jimin’s chest, tightly tucked in his arms, Yoongi apologise again. “I’m sorry you have to deal with this again.”

Jimin put a hand on Yoongi’s head “Don’t worry about it. Rest, we’ll figure it out later.”

10772274,2017,1191,35.0,,"Together under the Snow

Snow was falling hard at that night. Yoongi’s whole energy was sucked off his body. He didn’t know what actually sucked up his energy that day but it was pretty tiring for him. Well, he finished his work pretty late, producing songs and such, discussing it with the other producers. Maybe, that was the reason why he was so tired.

The other members of Bangtan already went home before him. Well, actually, Yoongi was the one who told them to go home first since he knew that he’s going to finish his work really late. He only asked the members to left him some food for him to eat.

Yoongi sighed as he packed up his things, ready to go home. Well, back to the dorms, if you must call it. He realized the LED of his phone was blinking, sign that he got a message. For Yoongi to receive a message that late. who was the one who sent him a message? It was almost midnight.

He unlocked his phone to see a message from his fellow team member, Jung Hoseok. It was a simple message, but it was clear enough to show that Hoseok was worried for Yoongi. “Yoongi-hyung, when will you come back home? It’s already late…”

His lips made a small smile. His dearly dongsaeng was actually worried for him that much, even though Hoseok got an intensive lesson of dancing earlier. Hoseok was probably as tired as Yoongi—maybe more—but he was worried about Yoongi. Yoongi continued to pack his things, not wanting to worry Hoseok more than that.

As he finished packing his things and ready to go home, Yoongi gave a small message to Hoseok. “I’m going back now, don’t worry. I’m on my way.”

Yoongi left the office and staring at the falling snowflakes. White snow was everywhere, it was very cold. Well, it was totally unexpected, since it was winter at that time.

The man tucked his hands on his red coat, wear the hoodie to cover his black hair, just to minimalize the coldness. Yoongi’s body was already freezing as it was, but he’ll try to manage to go home by walking. He didn’t want to burden his manager since it was nearly midnight and the manager also got more work tomorrow.

Yoongi slowly walked through the road, the way to his dorm.

The other members, probably, were already asleep. Once again, it was no surprise since it was nearly midnight. Probably, Jungkook and Taehyung were the only ones who were still awake, since those two often played until midnight—maybe more. Sometimes, Yoongi couldn’t help but worry at their health.

As Yoongi walked, his attention got caught by a convenience store nearby. He decided to buy small snacks, just in case his members didn’t leave him some food. Yoongi scanned through the snacks section and picked up his most favorite chips. His eyes caught on some chips that Hoseok might like. It was on discount too.

Maybe I should buy some for Hobi.

He picked it up and quickly paid it on the cashier. As he left the store, his phone rang. Yoongi quickly searched his phone on his pockets and looked who was calling. Well, not a surprise, it was his dongsaeng. Jung Hoseok.

“Hello? J hope?” Yoongi’s deep voice started up as he picked up the call.

A sigh of relief was heard. “Suga-hyung, it’s already late! Where are you?!”

“I was dropping by the convenience store for a while. Now, I’m on my way home.”

Hoseok gave Yoongi a small hmph. “You already message me that you’re on your way home 10 minutes ago. And it turns out, you’re actually in a convenience store. How could I believe you that you’re not going to visit another store and actually on your way home?”

“I’m really on my way home.” Yoongi insisted as he continued walking home. “Do you not believe me?”

A moment of silence engulfed the two. Hoseok sighed after that. “I’m starting to doubt you, hyung.”

Yoongi let a weak chuckle out. “Really, I’ll be home soon. I swear.”

“What if you don’t?”

“Do what you want with me. I’ll definitely come home soon.” Yoongi scoffed.

Hoseok gave a sigh to his hyung. “Fine then. I’ll wait until you come home.”

Yoongi was about to give Hoseok a reply but Hoseok already ended the call, resulting another tiring sigh from Yoongi. I’ll just go home faster and see Hoseok soon. He’s totally worried about me.

He walked faster than before to go back home and see Hoseok again. As he was getting near to the dorms, he saw a leaning figure near their dorm. If it wasn’t that late, he would’ve thought it was a fan or something. But it was too late for them to stay in front of their dorms.

As Yoongi stopped his steps, the figure lifted his head and let out a sigh of relief. Yoongi quickly recognize the figure. “J hope?” Yoongi called the name, just to make sure again.

Said man ran towards his hyung and hugged him. “You’re late…” Hoseok mumbled as he kept Yoongi in his embrace.

Without any hesitation, Yoongi dropped off his stuffs that he bought on the convenience store and hugged Hoseok back. Yoongi dived to Hoseok’s chest and snuggled to it, feeling comfort from it.

Yoongi didn’t let Hoseok go, and so did Hoseok. They stayed like that, embracing each other, in the middle of the night with snowflakes falling slowly on their head. Both of them, felt so comfortable. They refused to release each other.

Slowly, Hoseok patted Yoongi’s head with care. “Are you tired, hyung?”

Yoongi nodded, still on Hoseok’s chest. “The other producers didn’t really get the feeling of my new tunes so I need to remade it again. Well, it was pretty satisfying after that but I got home pretty late.”

“I see…” Hoseok slowly said. “You’ve done well today. You need to eat and then, rest. I left you some food on the kitchen.”

Yoongi let out a simple thanks from his mouth and hugged Hoseok more tightly, just his way to say thank you to his dongsaeng. As he hugged Hoseok, Yoongi suddenly realized that Hoseok was only wearing simple clothes. Without a coat on, only a simple long-sleeved shirt with long pants. “Why are you not wearing a jacket or anything? It’s totally cold out here.”

Hoseok only sighed at his hyung. “I never thought to bring up a coat outside. I just wanted to wait for you to go home.” The black-haired man looked up at the younger man. Hoseok only gave Yoongi a tender smile. “Welcome back, hyung.”

Yoongi released the hug and smiled to his dongsaeng. “I’m back.” Yoongi picked his stuffs up and motioned Hoseok to enter the dorms. “Let’s go in, I bought you your favorite chips earlier, so you better accompany me when I’m eating.”

“I will, so don’t worry, hyung.” Hoseok gave another angelic smile to the hyung beside him. “I’ll accompany you every time you need me.”

Yoongi chuckled. “That’s nice. Now, let’s go in.”

“Okay, okay.”"

Author's Note:

For jikookielove (jikookie).

lowkey warning for very normalised thoughts about death.

jeongguk hasn’t had a particularly bad day.

but by the time he gets home, the comfort of his own apartment surrounding him as he stands in the front entrance, it’s like whatever facade he’s been wearing all day crumbles. and it’s not that he feels sad or angry. just exhausted. tired.

he used to think the exhaustion would go away but sleep doesn’t resolve your extensional crisis and the fog he’s always trying to get ahead of seems inescapable. jeongguk imagines it’s a little like sinking into quicksand. at any given moment, at every given moment, he’s dying.

it’s not the kind of dead he wishes he was but he supposes this was just another way for life to say fuck you.

the television’s on, and what smells like chinese from jeongguk’s favourite place down the road wafts up to him. he smiles, remembers that even if every day is as quietly miserable as this one, he still has a light shining through the fog. he still has jimin.

“i’m home,” he calls out, slipping out of his shoes, loosening his tie. he pulls his jacket off and hangs it on the wooden coat stand jimin had insisted on getting the last time they were in ikea.

jimin’s response is immediate, perky and delighted and warm. jeongguk’s heart skips a beat. “hi baby!”

his head pokes out from over their couch, the yellow blanket they keep draped over the top wrapped around his shoulders. he’d finally gone through with dying his hair blond and if jeongguk was being honest, if he was being himself, he looked a lot like the sun coming out.

“i got food! i figured you’d be tired and i didn’t really feel like cooking. hope that’s okay?” jimin chatters on, chin propped up on their couch.

jeongguk just smiles, feels like he’s temporarily left his sadness hanging off the coat stand, too. he pads over to his boyfriend, chest a weird sort of tight, anxious and at-home all at once. it was a feeling he was still trying to get used to.

“i missed you,” jeongguk mumbles, cups jimin’s face in his hands. he still can’t believe it. holding jimin feels more and more like a dream every time he touches him, and jeongguk keeps waiting for the moment he wakes up, still lonely.

jimin, for all his usual bravado, flushes pretty and pink. jeongguk can’t stop staring at the way his eyes crinkle up, the way the tips of his ears go red, too. he squirms a little under jeongguk’s attentiveness, reaching up to tug jeongguk down, closer. jeongguk lets jimin kiss him, sweet and easy, savouring the plush softness of jimin’s mouth. he wonders how jimin always manages to taste so good, so much like everything jeongguk needs.

“missed you, too,” jimin whispers against jeongguk’s mouth, and it still makes jeongguk’s heart swell in a way that overwhelms him. they were one month away from their three year anniversary. jeongguk had bought an engagement ring exactly eight months ago. it had been a spur of the moment thing, jimin making some off-hand comment about the kind of ring he wanted after yoongi had finally proposed to namjoon. he hadn’t been able to sleep, had lied in bed with the revelation that he’d always known, all those years ago, that it was jimin. it couldn’t be anyone else. but gathering the courage to buy a ring and asking jimin to spend the rest of their lives together were two very different things. jeongguk still doesn’t feel brave enough.

jeongguk kisses the tip of jimin’s nose, and then his mouth, just to feel his lips against his own. “love you.”

“i love you, too, baby,” jimin murmurs, always without hesitation and jeongguk wonders what country he saved in a past life to hear those words from him. “you okay?”

“the usual,” jeongguk replies and jimin’s eyes go softer, frowning just the slightest. he wonders if he’ll ever be able to give a better response, if he’ll ever feel like he deserves jimin’s kindness and patience.

“you wanna cuddle?” jimin asks, and jeongguk only nods, doesn’t let go of jimin’s hand as he walks around the sofa to him. jimin’s got two pillows propped up against one end of the couch and he doesn’t let jeongguk switch them around, makes sure it’s jeongguk who’s lying with his head tucked under jimin’s chin.

“you know i like being the big spoon,” jeongguk grumbles even as he rests his head against jimin’s chest, can hear the steady sound of his heartbeat.

“what if i’ve hated being the small spoon this whole time, huh?”

“you’re a bad liar, hyung, you know that.”

“i’m a better liar than you!”

“that’s just because i can’t lie to you.”

“good, because you better not lie to me. or else!”

“wow, very threatening,” jeongguk laughs, eyes slipping shut. jimin’s hand cards through his hair, nails occasionally scratching over his scalp. it feels good, relaxing.

“don’t be a brat,” jimin scolds, but he presses a kiss into jeongguk’s hair, resting his cheek against him. “i love you, you know that?”

“yeah,” jeongguk breathes, loves how he can’t smell anything but jimin now.

“and you know i think you’re amazing?”

“i’m fine, hyung,” jeongguk sighs, even if he does appreciate jimin’s efforts. but sometimes words are just words and nothing more. jimin’s presence alone is enough, a comfort that feels like a luxury, like jeongguk's won some kind of lottery. “it’s...it’s nice just having you here. it’s enough.”

“okay,” jimin says, quiet. “i’m sorry you’re not feeling good, baby.”

“it’ll pass.” jeongguk’s survived this long, right? besides, he didn’t imagine death quite so intimately anymore. they were less like lovers, and more like friends, sometimes even just acquaintances. that was progress.

jimin hums, doesn’t let go, and jeongguk doesn’t fall asleep so much so as he just lies there with the warmth of jimin’s body, his existence lulling him to a more peaceful state of mind. the hand petting his hair never stops, the planes of their bodies slotted together perfectly.

jeongguk might be trapped in the fog, but the light never dims, and yeah, maybe he’ll be just fine."
11161479,2017,1151,47.0,2.0,"A Feeling

Author's Note:

This is kind of a soulmate au but not really? I might add more chapters.

Yoongi can’t remember the last time he felt… anything. For as long as he can remember he has lived his life through others, emotionally speaking. Although it wasn’t too bothersome not feeling emotions (as a businessman it was actually useful), at times Yoongi found himself wondering how his life would be different. He wouldn’t have to practice normal facial expressions in the mirror or study people so closely. Sure, with time it had become a lot easier to ‘express’ himself normally, but it still required him to constantly observe those around him.
That is until recently.
Yoongi looks down at his hands and makes them into loose fists before opening them again. A few days ago, while shaking hands with a possible investor, he experienced emotion for the first time. It was strange at first. He wondered if maybe he was suddenly able to feel, but soon after other man- somewhat awkwardly- removed his hand from his, he was back to emptiness. Yoongi shook his head, and flashed the man a practiced smile and then walked him out of the office. Once the door was closed and he was back in his chair, Yoongi looked at his hands. Then, without any other thought, he called his secretary into his office with the excuse that she bring him coffee. A few minutes later she walked in with a red mug in her hands and placed it on his desk. Before he realized what he was doing, he had reached out and touched the young girl’s hand. Her face had turned a light pink as she looked up at him, but he’d hardly noticed her. His mind had suddenly been flooded with a strange, soft feeling. I small smile crept up onto his lips and he’d quickly pulled his hand back from the girl, and dismissed her. Her smile had slowly vanished as she turned to leave.
Once again he looked at his hands. Ever since the moment he discovered this strange power, he had become obsessed, no, addicted. He found almost any excuse to lightly touch others’ hands. While getting his coffee in the morning, while at the store, at the office, anywhere. It became sort of a game. He would watch the person, try to guess at their emotion, and then confirm it. It was amazing that he was correct so many times.
He sat at a small coffeeshop now, looking at a young barista with long, brown hair and soft eyes. He watched her as she prepared his drink and then as she walked over to him. ‘She’s feeling tired, probably hoping to go home to her family’ he thought to himself as she placed the cup on the table. He smoothly reached for the cup just before her hand left the mug and he touched the tips of her fingers. She turned to leave not noticing what happened and he was washed over by a soft feeling… something like happiness, but… sad along the edges. He stared at his cup, as the feeling slowly faded. He blinked a couple times and then looked up at the girl, who was now cleaning a table. She did not look particularly happy, or sad. He frowned. ‘Maybe a lover was waiting for her and she was excited to see him’ he thought to himself, ‘but what about the sadness?’
He shook his head and look down at his hands. Maybe this strange ability would only work for a few days? Yoongi did not want to go back, now that he knew how this felt. He liked feeling, even if it was only for a few seconds. It was a hunger he never knew he had, and now was unwilling to let go of. He got up from his seat, picked up his cup, and walked over to the counter where the girl was now standing by the register. She smiled politely as he approached and he flashed yet another practiced smile.
“I’m sorry, my coffee got a bit cold,” he said softly as he placed the cup on the counter.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” she said as she picked up the cup, “I’ll make you another one,” then she turned around.
Yoongi watched as she once again prepared his drink, trying to think harder this time. ‘She smiled at me,’ he thought, ‘so maybe she is not tired, but happy.’ He was so lost in his thoughts he didn’t realize she was back.
“Okay, here it is.” She smiled again. Yoongi could never understand how people gave away smiles so easily and so often. He had to practice, observe, and guess at the right moment while others seemed to do it without much thought.
He reached out for the mug just as she reached out to place a napkin next to it. Their hands touched and Yoongi felt something… hot. ‘Frustrated,’ he thought to himself, ‘she must be frustrated with me because I let my drink get cold. But when he looked up she was smiling, light pink dusting her cheeks, her eyes reduced to small lines.
“Oh I’m sorry about that,” she said.
“It’s okay, don’t worry.” he answered, still lost in his thoughts.
This girl was strange. Her emotions did not align with her expressions. Or perhaps he was the one that was strange. Well of course he was strange but… he shook his head. This is pointless. He drank his coffee and then left the shop, waving at the girl on his way out.
He looked down at his hands, he has been doing this a lot lately.
Yoongi found himself at the cafe almost every day after that. Every time he challenged himself, and every time he failed. For some reason he could never figure the girl out. She always seemed to be friendly on the outside but frustrated on the inside. Then it hit him one day, as his fingers touched the tips of hers. She smiled warmly at him, a regular customer, and yet the feeling that washed over him was frustration- as usual- but this time it had softer edges and he found himself with an almost unnoticeable smile on his lips. He blinked and looked at the girl’s back before looking down at his hands again.
He could not believe it. He would have laughed- this seemed like something to laugh about- but it would have been too strange in the quiet of the shop. But suddenly, a frown crept up his on face. Why was this different from the dozens of hands he had touched before? He turned to the girl again. Was it just her? He thought, for a second, maybe he would get up and ask her something, maybe even slide his hand towards hers just a tiny bit. He wanted to challenge himself once more.
Instead he finished his coffee, said goodbye to the girl, and walked out into the cold."

The first time Namjoon hears Seokjin’s voice, Seokjin tells Namjoon he loves him.

He was ten minutes into a call with Seokjin when it happened. Namjoon had been in the middle of the footpath, power walking to the 8AM class he had often found himself skipping, when his phone had rung.

The air was slightly cold as Namjoon made his way down the route he walked every day. Buds were starting to bloom on the trees again and the birds were finally starting to sing in beautiful lilts that carried through the campus. Namjoon had wrapped a scarf twice around his neck that morning but the rush to his first class had left his neck too warm, and he suspected it would be damp when he pulled his scarf off. His phone started to ring so he pulled it out of his pocket while he walked and flustered himself trying to untangle his earphones and pulg them in fast enough.

Seokjin was calling him on FaceTime, which was a first, so Namjoon answered. Seokjin didn’t turn the camera on, so Namjoon didn’t either, but he knew what Seokjin’s face looked like. Had seen it on his phone screen a hundred times. The first time, on his HelloTalk icon, the second, on his Snapchat story. Had seen his face in his iMessage when Seokjin sent him an image of him at a party with two friends, that Namjoon had saved to his camera roll. Had seen his face behind his eyelids when he turned the lights off and put his hand underneath his boxers. Had seen his face on Namjoon’s computer when he felt especially lonely.

So while Namjoon mourned the absence of Seokjin’s face on his tiny phone screen, it was only temporarily.

“Namjoon-ah,” Seokjin says and Namjoon feels his heart melt. Stops himself in the middle of the footpath and sits on the steps outside a building. He doesn’t need to go to his sociology class anyway. “I got in.” Namjoon unwinds the scarf from around his neck, it’s slick with sweat but the rest of his body is too cold.

Seokjin’s accent is thick and heavy but it’s not surprising to Namjoon. “Congratulations,” he says down the phone.

“I would not been able to do it without you,” Seokjin says through the phone so sincerely Namjoon smiles out in the open.

“Have been,” he corrects instinctively.

Seokjin chuckles slightly and it’s so warm and light that Namjoon feels he could float in it forever. Let it wrap around his body and engulf him. “Ah,” the voice says through the phone. “Gamsahaeyo.”

Seokjin’s English pronunciation is good, he had always worked harder than Namjoon had at his target language. Namjoon thinks now that maybe this is because he actually had a goal. “You’re welcome,” he says foregoing speaking Korean in reply. Seokjin notices of course and he laughs. “You will not have better Korean if you do not practice.”

“I know,” Namjoon says and rests his chin on his open palm as he sits watching students pass by. He sounds fond, even to his own ears, but prays that because this is the first time Seokjin has heard his voice he won’t pick up on it. Is thankful Yoongi isn’t here to hear it and never let Namjoon forget how much he sounds like he’s in love with a man who lives on the other side of the planet. Maybe Namjoon is in love with a man who lives on the other side of the planet. He doesn’t want to think too hard about it.

But still, Namjoon sits there and he thanks the world for technology, for his mother pestering him to relearn his native language, for the App store putting HelloTalk on his list of app recommendations, for Seokjin being the first person who spoke Korean to appear at the top of the list when Namjoon opened the app.

Hello? He had written, unsure if he was supposed to speak English or Korean to the stranger. But he had put ‘beginner’ for Korean in his bio, and this stranger was at ‘intermediate’ level English. So Namjoon said hello.

Hi! 안녕하세요! ^.^ Came the reply twenty minutes later.

Namjoon thinks a lot about Seokjin. Thinks about everything Seokjin has taught him beyond just Korean. Thinks about how hard Seokjin works to accomplish his dreams, and now thinks about how his constant struggles when practicing English with Namjoon have payed off. “Jin?” Namjoon says into the phone and Seokjin hums. “I’m really proud of you for getting into the exchange program.” Seokjin makes a scoffing noise into the receiver but he sounds slightly flustered. Namjoon wishes he could see if Seokjin is blushing on the other end.

Students keep walking by him, birds keep coming and going from tree branches and Seokjin says, “Namjoon-ah, I love you. Thank you for everything.”

Namjoon feels too warm, like the beginnings of a fever is spreading through his body. It sounds like Seokjin is saying goodbye. It makes sense that he would be. His English is incredible now, he got accepted into the program he had been working towards for the past year. Namjoon’s skills are now obsolete.

“It’s okay, you’re welcome,” Namjoon replies. He wants to say I love you too. Has wanted to for the past year. But he doesn’t. He stands up, dusts his pants off and begins to walk towards the library. There’s no point attending his sociology lecture now. “I’ll talk to you later, okay?” He says this but he feels scared, because he’s convinced himself that ‘later’ doesn’t actually exist anymore. He’s fulfilled his purpose. Seokjin has accomplished everything he needed to and doesn’t need Namjoon anymore.

But then Seokjin says “Of course,” and that tinny voice coming through the phone call is the most beautiful thing Namjoon has ever heard. “You have much Korean to improve on. Goodbye.”

Namjoon hangs up and grins up into the open air of the blue sky. Two birds fly above his head. It sounds much more like a promise than a goodbye.

Author's Note:

HAPPY BELATED WORLD BALLET DAY there is honestly no point to this fic so yeah

(if you don't know dance terms you're gonna be a bit confused near the beginning)

Note: 95% of italics are Yoongi using sign-language to communicate (once again, no point for Yoongi to be mute, but he is)

Yoongi hesitantly opened the heavy door to the dance studio. He slipped in, hiding the bouquet of red roses behind his back as he crept to the left wall to watch his boyfriend dance. Once he was settled down, he couldn't tear his eyes away.

Jimin was wearing one of Yoongi’s loose black tanks, tight black leggings showing off all of his muscles, and light pink canvas shoes. Yoongi watched for a bit before realizing that he could identify some of the moves from when Jimin had taught him the names the year before.

Jimin chassed into a grand jete, landing only to lead into a double, no, triple, no, a quintuple pirouette. He chained twice to the left, plied, and leapt to a calypso. God, Jimin’s legs were so powerful. Another series of chasses to the right, a grand jete, a developpe, and a russian to the front. Jimin’s shirt briefly flew up, and Yoongi had to wet his lips at the fleeting sight of his abs. Jimin allegroed back to the center and bent his back leg and body into a scorpion. With his back arched, hands pulling his leg nearly into a split in the air, and his head thrown back, Jimin looked magnificent.

The classical music died down, and Jimin held his position for several more seconds until he finally lowered his back leg.

""Yoongi, I know you're here."" Jimin panted, a smile on his face, as he swiped at his forehead. ""This room is literally just mirrors.""

Yoongi smiled sheepishly and gestured for Jimin to come to him with a wave of his hand. He only felt a little bit guilty, seeing how heavily Jimin was breathing, but Yoongi didn't want to ruin the surprise. Jimin quickly walked over, sitting down in front of Yoongi to pull off his pointe shoes. Jimin stretched out his toes, sighing with relief. Yoongi reached behind himself and pulled out the bouquet. Jimin blushed redder than he already was because of dancing. ""What's this for, baby?""

Yoongi smiled shyly. Happy World Ballet Day to my favorite ballerina Yoongi signed. you were breathtaking today, like always. Yoongi nervously played with his earring, hoping that Jimin wouldn’t find it too cheesy or stupid.

Jimin broke out into a disbelieving smile. ""Yoongi, you're so cute!"" He giggled musically, breathing in the sweet scent of the roses. He hugged the rose bouquet. ""I would hug you right now but I'm super sweaty, so.""

Yoongi sighed in relief that Jimin found the flowers okay, signing go take a shower then, loser.

Jimin scrunched up his nose, sticking out his tongue. ""On that note, I suddenly want a hug from you right this instant."" He moved on top of Yoongi to pepper his face with kisses, Yoongi shaking with silent laughter underneath him. Yoongi managed to grab Jimin’s wrists and held them away to stop Jimin from attacking him. Jimin smiled one of his sweetest smiles, the one where his eyes curved into crescents and his cheeks bunched up into little apples. Yoongi stared him in the eyes. His boyfriend was so beautiful, even with his bangs plastered to his head with sweat and face flushed with exhaustion. Yoongi reached up, caressing Jimin’s cheek softly. He was so lucky that the younger boy agreed to go out with him several months ago, after three years of being close friends.

""Nothing better be happening over here."" Hoseok, a hip-hop dancer who usually shared the time slot in the dance studio with Jimin, muttered as he walked in. The door to the studio swung shut behind him. He raised his eyebrows at them in jokingly condescending manner, hands on his hips. ""I already had to clean up a strange stain off of the dance floor two nights ago.""

Jimin let out a squeak, face once again coloring scarlet. Yoongi made weak motions with his hands, before finding a place to start furiously explaining that the stain wasn't what he thought it was it was actually the stain from the leftover coffee he brought that Jimin accidentally kicked and maybe they didn't clean it all like they thought- Hoseok held out his hand.

""Slow down there, Yoongo. Make all the excuses you want, I know what you're into. That's what best friends are for!"" And with that, Hoseok had the nerve to skip away into the locker room to get changed before Yoongi could respond.

Yoongi buried his face in his hands, mortified. He never should have told Hoseok anything. Jimin pried his hands away.

""You tell Hoseok things?"" Jimin asked, curiously, with a cheeky smirk on his face. ""Did you tell him about last week when you wanted me to-""

Yoongi nearly slammed his hand over Jimin's mouth. He shook his head rapidly, slowly taking his hand away to sign he only knows that we have sex a bunch, nothing else. Jimin burst out laughing, throwing his body forward and whacking Yoongi's chest.

""Oh my god, you totally tell Hoseok about our sex life, Yoongi!"" Jimin couldn't contain himself as he slumped onto Yoongi's chest. After a couple of deep breaths and Yoongi's discomfort, he stopped his laughing. ""It's okay, baby. I tell Tae."" Yoongi dropped his mouth open. you hypocrite.

Hoseok walked back outside, dressed out in his dance clothes. He bent over his right leg in a stretch. ""Jimin you gonna shower, or will I have to keep witnessing both of you trying to keep your hands off of each other?""

Jimin jumped off of Yoongi's lap. ""Right. I forgot that was a thing."" He leaned forward to press a brief kiss against Yoongi’s cheek, and then walked to the locker room, blowing Yoongi another kiss before he went inside. Yoongi pretended to catch the kiss and held his fist to his heart.

Hoseok stopped stretching to glance at Yoongi, whose head was still focused at the locker room door as if he could see Jimin through it. ""You're so whipped, man. Jimin could dab to the worst song ever and you would preach about his skill to me.""

Yoongi gazed at the discarded and nearly destroyed canvas shoes Jimin had tucked next to him. A quick glance to make sure Hoseok was watching his hands, and there's nothing to do at this point, Hobi. Yoongi stroked the satin cloth stretched around the shoe. I love my ballerina.

Author's Note:

Who should I do next?

You never know who you’re going to see when you visit your friend Yoongi. You don’t know if you’re going to see Yoongi himself, a calm and quiet man who keeps to himself but is also very sweet. Or Suga, the cuddly man that wants your attention on him no matter what. Lastly there’s Agust D, someone you’re scared of seeing. He’s rude and demeaning, always making you avoid Yoongi for a week. You don’t see him come out very often, and you’re glad you don’t.

__________

Yoongi

_

“Yoongi-ah?” You call out, knocking on his front door. You hope he’s not in his studio, if he is then you’ll have to find his spare key again. He shouldn’t be there though because you called him before you got here, and he said he was in his room.

It’s not long before footsteps can be heard nearing the door. You take a few steps back as the door swings open revealing a paler than usual Yoongi.

“Have you been pulling all-nighters in your studio again?” You deadpan, watching the man carefully. It looks like he could faint any second now.

“You know me so well. Come in.” Yoongi steps away from the doorway, letting you enter the house.

You two watch TV and talk about recent things that have happened for the most part of your visit. Neither of you wanted to cook so you ordered pizza instead. Hours afterwards it’s time for you to head home. You bid farewell to Yoongi before heading home to sleep.

____

Suga

_

You tried calling Yoongi multiple times to warn him that you’re coming over but he doesn’t answer. You finally opt to just send him a message saying you’re coming over. Surprisingly he responded to that. No matter what mood he’s in, he hardly ever replies to texts you send him.

Nonetheless you leave the house and head to his place.

When you get there, the door is locked as you expected so you knock on the door. You hear heavy footsteps as if someone is running towards the door and the door swings open. A cheerful Yoongi is standing there in a t-shirt, shorts, and the gag apron you’d bought him last year.

“(Y/N)! Come in!” The man exclaims, grabbing your wrist and pulling you inside. Once he’s slammed the door shut he releases your wrist and you notice the slight red marks appearing on your skin.

You inhale the smell of chocolate chips and send the man a questioning look. The last time you checked Yoongi didn’t bake nor was he into sweets.

“Chocolate chip pancakes. For you.” Yoongi states, too bubbly for his usual self. You frown but nod nonetheless, letting him drag you into the kitchen. You want to question the elder on his sudden change in behavior but you kind of find this cute.

“Yoongi-“ The elder cuts you off by squeezing your wrist painfully tight. You yelp and attempt to snatch your arm away but his grip only tightens.

“The name’s Suga. Not that grumpy old man.” “Suga” says through clenched teeth. His face is pulled into a painful smile as he sits you in a chair, finally letting go of your wrist. He sits in the seat across from you.

You wince a little as you rub your wrist in little circles. Suga watches you with an upset expression on his face.

“I’m sorry that I hurt you. Please don’t be mad at me.” Suga pleads, reaching across the table to grab a hold of your hand but you flinch away from his touch. Suga pouts but pulls his hand back nonetheless. He stands and walks to the counter where the pancakes are, placing a stack in front of you. You give him another questioning look as if to ask him why he’s not eating as well.

“I’m not hungry yet. Go ahead and eat.” Suga says with a dismissive wave of his hand. You don’t question him further, instead enjoying the sweet aroma of chocolate filling the kitchen.

After you finish eating you hang around a little longer, not really because you wanted to but because of Suga’s insistence. The remainder of your visit consisted of you and Suga cuddling under a blanket and watching a movie. When the movie was over, it took a lot of convincing for Suga to let you go home but you managed it somehow.

____

Agust D

_

The first thing that set you off when you entered, using the spare key, is the smell of sex. The second thing was the trail of clothes leading upstairs. Instead of going upstairs no matter how curious you were, you head to the kitchen to make yourself some coffee. You’re learning from the mistake you made months ago, never go upstairs when there’s underwear on the stairs. You shudder at the thought of the first and last time you did that.

“You insensitive bastard!” A woman screams from upstairs, followed by the sound of something breaking and footsteps stomping out of Yoongi’s bedroom. You barely catch a glimpse of the woman in questions as she storms out the front door, all her belongings in her arms.

You hear a grumble before footsteps thud down the stairs.

“That fucking bitch,” Yoongi grumbles, coming towards the kitchen before stopping and looking at you,” And here’s another one.” He growls, making you flinch. You give him a meek smile before turning your attention back on making coffee. You hear him come closer until you can feel him hovering over you. You don’t bother turning around, entirely intending on making coffee.

“What the fuck are you doing here so early in the morning?” Yoongi hisses into your ear, making you jump.

“Making coffee obviously. I sent you a text Yoongi.” You state as confidently as you can. But all your confident leaves when the man slams his hands down on the counter, making you jump out of your skin.

“Don’t say that weaklings name in my presence. It’s Agust D.” Agust D growls, forcefully turning you around and slamming you against the counter. Out of fear you push Agust D away from you and run for the door.

“And don’t come back you little bitch!” Agust D screams after you, making you slam the door close even harder. You swear to yourself that you won’t come back for a while."

Yoongi groaned, rolling back in his wheely chair so that the bluish glow of the computer screen no longer washed over his face. His eyes were strained from glaring at the screen for over an hour, slender fingers poised perfectly over the black keys but never doing much more than that. It was stupid, really, how much trouble he was having coming up with something to plug into the computer. He’d tried going through the memos on his phone where he stored random phrases whenever he was hit with inspiration but he still couldn’t think. They were supposed to de-stress today, getting drunk off of each other’s joys as they celebrated their success, it was their anniversary after all. But the party didn’t start until after dinner, and so Yoongi had taken it upon himself to work on his music for the majority of the day since no one else seemed to be interested in joining him. A sigh escaped his lips as he leaned back on the chair, eyes closing gently.

It had been 4 years.

It hadn’t been easy, but Yoongi had preoccupied himself all day so he wouldn’t have to think about it. Sitting in the Genius Lab now, with darkness enveloping him aside from the soft glow of the computer screen, he didn’t have much of a choice in where his mind took him. He could almost picture how they all were 4 years ago, scrawny kids arriving in the large city of Seoul with nothing more than a willingness to debut and each other. A warm sort of fondness flooded through Yoongi’s body and his slight lips slipped up into a small smile. He remembered all of them huddled together in their small dorm room, crying after their first win with “I Need U”. Yoongi had clutched onto Namjoon firmly, tears dampening the younger boy’s shoulder. He could still picture a shiny eyed Jimin in the elevator, trying hard not to burst into tears as the camera filmed him. They’d come so far in such little time that it was hard to believe, but Yoongi wouldn’t have it any other way.

The soft alert from his phone shook Yoongi out of his thoughts, he blew a few strands of hair out of his eyes as he unlocked his phone to access Twitter. One look at the picture had him up and out of his chair, speed walking hastily to Namjoon’s room with his ears tinted red. The picture that Namjoon had just posted was of him and Yoongi, back in their rookie years. Yoongi looked like an awkward, lanky, over-sized boy wearing his older brother’s clothes. His hair was fashioned in that trademark “2009-it’s-not-a-phase-mom” look. Yoongi’s cheeks heated up in embarrassment as he gripped his phone tightly, his jaw clenched. Was Namjoon trying to ruin his life?

Yoongi burst into Namjoon’s room with a glare set on his face, his phone held up.

""Namjoon, explain,“ Yoongi’s gravelly voice cut through the seemingly silent room, it wasn’t until he noticed the figure hunched over on the edge of his bed that he straightened up, arms falling to his sides as his eyes softened. Namjoon wasn’t exactly someone you could call small, but in that moment that’s exactly what he looked like. Small and young and easily breakable. Namjoon had his face hidden in his hands, silent tears rolling down his face. He sat up a little taller when he heard Yoongi’s voice, wiping at his tear stained cheeks with the back of his hands. Yoongi expected a broken expression on the younger boy’s face, something that would render him incapable of providing words of consolation. And yet, when he slowly crossed the room to stand in front of Namjoon, awkwardly ruffling his hair as the other looked up at him, he saw nothing but happiness. A dimple appeared on Namjoon’s cheek as he gave the elder a small smile.

""Is everything.. alright?” His eyes were trained on Namjoon’s face, searching for any signs of sadness, but there didn’t seem to be any. Yoongi was confused. Namjoon gave him a slow shake of the head as he stood up.

The tears involuntarily sprang to Yoongi’s eyes as he watched Namjoon wiping his cheeks softly with the sleeves of his sweater, “I was just-,” His voice thickened as he choked back tears, “Do you remember when we were trainees?” Yoongi watched, surprised, as Namjoon wrapped his arms around him, burying his face into Yoongi’s shoulder. He could feel Namjoon mumbling into the fabric of his shirt, “I can’t stop thinking about it.”

And then suddenly, they were no longer in Namjoon’s room. They were back in the stuffy practice room, where Yoongi had found an exhausted Namjoon looking down at the ground in defeat, drops of water occasionally falling to the wooden flooring below. Where Yoongi had gathered Namjoon up into a hug only to find out that he’d been having thoughts of giving up. Yoongi had whispered words of comfort in Namjoon’s ear along with promises of a bright future filled with Daesangs and devoted fans and being the pride of their families. He still remembered what Namjoon had said to him that day, his voice cracking as he breathed out in a shaky voice, “Hyung I can’t - I can’t do this anymore.”

Namjoon’s shoulders were shaking as Yoongi wrapped an arm around his torso, running his other hand up and down Namjoon’s back soothingly. His gravelly voice seemed smaller as they held onto each other to anchor themselves in reality, “I’ll never be able to forget, Namjoon,” Yoongi took in a deep breath as he lightly stroked Namjoon’s hair, “Those were the days that shaped us into being, the ones we’ll hold onto forever because they’ll constantly serve as a reminder to never give up. Look at where we are now.”

Yoongi gently peeled himself away from the other, taking him by the shoulders as he looked into his shining eyes, a small smile made it’s way onto his face, “We’ve finally made it, Nams.”

Namjoon thought of their many concerts, their countless awards, their dedicated fans, their parents who could now proudly tell others who their sons were, the nights all seven of them had spent in one room, voicing their concerns about the future and dreams of debuting in hushed voices. He pictured them crying about their insecurities a few years ago, and how the only reason behind their tears these days was because they’d finally realized their dreams of being at the top. Namjoon smiled.

“Yeah, we have.”

Taehyung patiently waited outside of the bathroom. He could hear the mix of cries and gagging from the other side. It pained to hear them but he knew Jimin was in more pain. He knew how much Jimin hated himself over it and tried everything to stop it. All Taehyung could do, as a friend, was to be patient and help clean up the mess. Taehyung never commented about this issue as Jimin would always brush it off each time they brought it up. All Taehyung could do was grab a towel, hand it over to his best friend as he flushed his puke down the toilet and carry him out.

“You can't just expect me to pretend this isn't serious, y’know?” Taehyung nagged, helping Jimin out of the bathroom. Taehyung dragged Jimin onto the couch and hoped the other wouldn't throw his guts up at the sight of the leftover Chinese takeout. Luckily, all Jimin did was groan and stuff his head between the cushions of the couch.

“I feel like I've been faced fucked by some crusty dry ass dick. I swear I puked out bile along with the rest of my food.” Jimin groaned, trying to become one with the couch. It was depressing for Taehyung to watch Jimin slowly becoming all skin and bones. His body had went from being perfectly fine to being frail and gangly. Taehyung had decided it was best to clean up while Jimin sulked in the couch. After cleaning and dispose of the food, he came back and found Jimin sitting up. Taehyung could see how weary and red-rimmed his eyes were. Taehyung knew he was crying over the same mistake again but it was only because he had no serious control over it.

He tip-toed his way to Jimin, trying to not snap him out of his trance. The shorter was probably tired and possibly not even in the mood to talk at all. Taehyung still made it his mission to cheer the other up because that's what best friends are for. They're always there to help you out and what kind of friend would Taehyung be if he couldn't even cheer his own best friend? A terrible one that's that.

“Hey, maybe we could watch some movies? We don’t need to have popcorn if you don't wanna. I can make some hot cocoa instead and we can be shitty critics to movies we already watched.” Taehyung suggested, trying to cheer the other up. It was all he could do as he didn't want to fuss over Jimin who would decline the caring Taehyung offered. Instead of talking, Jimin only nodded, eyes still staring into nothing. On days like these, Jimin would only want to stare at nothing as his mind swam in insecure thoughts that spoke louder than others. It hurts to see him attempt to pick himself up and act like nothing happened when he steps out of their apartment door.

Taehyung could only sigh as he slipped himself into the kitchen and make the best cheer up hot cocoa he could ever make. As he heated up the milk, he could hear shuffling across the living room and a door creak open. Taehyung only hoped that Jimin wouldn't do anything crazy while he was in the kitchen because the last thing Taehyung needed was burning the kitchen down while trying to save Jimin from doing something possibly life-threatening. It didn't seem to be the kind of death Taehyung wanted if he were to die at the age of 22.

After a few minutes, he could hear more shuffling and heaving. A huge thud was heard which gave Taehyung a clear idea what Jimin was doing.

“ChimChim, are you actually making the fort this time?” Taehyung teased, all he got for an answer was a scoff and a yelp. ‘Jimin must’ve tripped over the pillows again’, Taehyung thought to himself. With two mugs in hand, Taehyung returned to their shared living room to see Jimin looking pleased with his finished product. Taehyung could still see how he was still a little worn out from the earlier incident but it was good to know Jimin managed to distract himself from those thoughts. All that mattered now was the proud smile plastered onto Jimin’s face.

Despite Taehyung finding the need of a pillow fort a little childish in a way (even though Taehyung himself was a childish man himself and was probably more childish than Jimin on other days), he had to admit that Jimin’s creation really showed how he wasn’t good at physics and arts for nothing. The fort had enough space for all the kicking and tickling they both knew would happen at one point while watching the movie. They settled in the fort, mugs placed aside on the coffee table as they go through their selection of movies. They came to a conclusion to settle on watching a Japanese animation teenage romance movie that circulated around the deaf. Taehyung knew Jimin loved that movie and knew the story like that back of his hand but still cried at the ending regardless.

Whatever plans Taehyung had before this was completely thrown out of the window as it didn’t really matter at this point. With Jimin tucked next to him in that pile of pillows and blankets, his eyes glued to the screen. Taehyung didn’t see the problem with cancelling an outing he was supposed to go to.

“Thanks, Tae.” Jimin hummed his thanks to the other while leaning against the other’s shoulder. Taehyung felt happy at the sight of Jimin’s soft smile, it meant so much to him.

“What are friends for?” Taehyung joked, attempting to hug Jimin despite the protest he was making.

“You’re right. We’re more than that, we're best friends. I should be expecting more from you.” Jimin joked back, making Taehyung feel offended.

“How dare you, Park Jimin! How dare you!” Taehyung gasped, trying to hide the small bubbling laughter he had. Jimin laughed at the reaction, Taehyung couldn’t help it but laugh along as well. The movie playing in the background had been long forgotten as Taehyung tickled Jimin who tried to fight back. At that moment, all worries and heavy weighted thoughts on Jimin seemed to have been lifted right in front of Taehyung’s eyes. It made Taehyung happy even though he knew very well this happiness was all temporary. Taehyung just hopes one day it’ll be permanent and till then, Taehyung would do everything to make sure it becomes a reality."

Namjoon walked to the book store with a heavy heart, his arms screaming in protest at the hefty weight he was carrying. The large plastic shopping bags that he had found lying in the kitchen were laden with a bunch of his books, books he had cherished and that had given him so much knowledge and information, books he had loved.

Books that he was now selling to a local bookshop, where the owner had made him an offer he couldn’t refuse – no other book store had agreed to buy so many of his books, especially for the price he was asking for, but the rather eccentric owner had insisted that he be the one to purchase Namjoon’s tomes and had even offered a higher price for it than what Namjoon had originally asked for. The man, ‘Taehyung’ according to his nametag, had seemed almost entranced by the notes that were scribbled in the margins of the texts. Seeing the writing, he hadn’t lowered the price as many other stores had tried to do, but increased it saying the books were worth so much more now.

Which meant that even though he felt sad parting with his treasures, Namjoon was glad they were going to a good home. He was sure that anyone else who shopped at the second-hand book store would also appreciate the thoughts he had littered in the pages.

See… Namjoon may have cherished his books but he cherished one person a lot more.

He felt that his story had become somewhat like the fantasy tales he had read as a child. He grew up in love with literature, a child genius who excelled in the arts as well as the sciences. Getting a joint degree in Biology and Psychology, Namjoon managed to shock everyone in his small village by graduating with honours from university at the young age of 14 on a scholarship, and even went on to get a Masters in Philosophy by the time he was 17. That kind of achievement didn’t go unnoticed of course, and Namjoon had been hired by the royal family as a tutor for the youngest prince.

Prince Seokjin had been training to become king (his official crowning ceremony having been planned for the summer after he turned 25), but his younger brother Jungkook spent his time throwing himself into arts and sports, avoiding study. The royal family had been worried that despite their plans to have Jungkook be in charge of the military, the youngest prince was too focused on the physical requirements to be a soldier and not enough on the intellect needed to be a leader.

That was why Namjoon had been hired. He worked his hardest with the young prince, drawing out the more sensitive and empathetic parts of Jungkook’s personality, gaining the boy’s admiration quickly until he had become rather enamoured by his teacher – and Namjoon became equally enamoured by the young man who worked so hard at everything, who had such a warm heart, who had the cutest smile he had ever seen, and who was trapped by his position.

And so, with Prince Seokjin’s help, the two stole away from the kingdom the night of Jungkook’s 20th birthday with the promise from Seokjin that once he was king, he would amend the laws to allow whoever was in love to love freely.

It had been three months since the two had run to a neighbouring kingdom, and Namjoon hadn’t realised just how much Jungkook had sacrificed for him until they had gone grocery shopping the day before. Namjoon had just gotten paid the wage he got for working at the town school, and so he had told Jungkook they could buy a treat for dinner.

He had watched with sad eyes as Jungkook chucked various treats into their basket with his beautiful bunny smile radiantly shining on his face. He had forgotten that while he was used to living on a smaller budget with few treats and luxuries in his life, Jungkook had grown up with maids waiting on him hand and foot, with his every whim being tended to, with the best home and experiences any one person could have.

Not once had his young love complained about the changes that he’d had to face with their running away together, and it saddened Namjoon to see that he couldn’t provide Jungkook with the same happiness he grew up with. Namjoon had paid for the groceries caring little about the fact that he really shouldn’t spend so much on food what with the other necessities they needed to pay for. It just led to Namjoon eventually making the decision to make his own sacrifices, dropping his books off at Taehyung’s store.

But no matter. They had received missive from Seokjin earlier that day that the new law was in the process of being solidified. With clever negotiation, Seokjin was not only in the process of changing the law to allow love to be free, but according to the newspapers and fliers, the young king had also cemented an alliance with the king of the kingdom that Namjoon and Jungkook were residing in – it seemed that Seokjin had fallen in love with King Yoongi when they both saw each other at various balls, and so with their union in marriage, the two kingdoms would merge and bring prosperity to all. With such promise, the officials and the people found it difficult to argue with the change, only a few radically ignorant people being vocal about their displeasure. Namjoon would never have predicted it.

When he got home later that day to an excited Jungkook, he smiled widely at his bunny. They would be able to go home soon. So what if his bookshelves were a little emptier? As Namjoon looked at the happiness on Jungkook’s face when he spotted the celebratory cake that Namjoon had bought with some of the money earned from the books, he found he didn’t regret a thing.

The Republic may have been an interesting read, but nothing was worth more to him than Jungkook’s smile.

Author's Note:

this has been translated by kroll into russian, here!

Yoongi’s first---and up until recently, his only---relationship was back during his first year of college. If one could call his brief fling with Yuri a relationship. There was mutual attraction, they were cool with each other, but not enough to extend their dates pass one month or kiss more than a handful of times. After Yuri, there wasn’t anyone else Yoongi was interested in enough to bother pursuing, and as time went on, he became too busy with his studies and internship to consider a relationship. Yoongi wanted something permanent. If he couldn’t put his all into someone and receive the same effort back, then he wouldn’t bother.

Meeting Namjoon right after graduation was unexpected. But there he was, being introduced to a slender guy with supernovas for dimples, someone Yoongi’s director said he would be collaborating with on a project because he thought their “ personalities complimented each other well. ”

Falling for Namjoon was unexpected, maybe slightly unwanted, because Yoongi couldn’t get see how someone like Namjoon would want to be with someone like Yoongi. He remembered talking himself out of kissing Namjoon once, and then accidentally blurting out how he wasn’t Namjoon’s type. Namjoon, carefully, slowly, had said, “You shouldn’t speak so lowly of yourself,” before kissing Yoongi.

Yoongi gave into him after that, despite the apprehension that liked to sneak around.

He wasn’t nervous Namjoon was his first serious relationship, or because his emotions toward him felt overwhelming at times.

He was nervous because Namjoon had a dog. And an 5-year-old child.

After knocking on the door, Yoongi heard a few barks and scratches on the door, someone say, “ Tae, get down ,” before the door swung open to reveal a sight Yoongi’s heart always thudded a little harder at.

He was a bit (a lot, overly, ridiculously so) sweet for Namjoon.

“Hey, Joon,” he greeted, smile easy because seeing Namjoon after a long or short absent always did things to Yoongi. Namjoon held his hand, squeezing tightly as he leaned forward, and about to kiss Yoongi when a sharp yip halted him.

Namjoon chuckled shyly as he backed up. “I gotta talk to the babysitter about a few more things, then I’ll be ready. Give me two more minutes?”

“Yeah, sure, I’ll just be right here,” Yoongi said, then Namjoon squeezed his hand again before retreating inside. Yoongi tugged at the hem of his sweater, rocking back on the heels of his boots. He shouldn’t be nervous, this wasn’t their first date, but the jitters always insisted on third-wheeling when he didn’t want them to. Yoongi shut his eyes, mumbled to himself to “ just chill out ,” and then opened his eyes again.

The noise he let out was a weird mixture between a grunt and an unflattering squeak. Perhaps he shouldn’t have been that startled, but he wasn’t expecting to see a dog and a child standing before him, eyes trained on him like laser beams aiming for an intruder.

Tae, a short-haired brown dog, kept flickering his ears back and forth as he looked Yoongi over. For a funny moment, Yoongi thought Tae was trying to catch a signal because he found it hard to believe Tae was just a regular, normal dog according to Namjoon.

“Hey, boy,” Yoongi said, bending down to scratch Tae’s head. Tae’s tail shot up, but otherwise he barely responded. “Hey, Jiminie.”

Yoongi didn't mind children. He wasn’t frightened by 5-year-olds, and there was nothing intimidating about Jimin. He inherited his father’s cuteness with his plush cheeks and misty eyes. He made Yoongi weak as well, made Yoongi want to go out and buy him unnecessary gifts and candy. And yet, with every visit, Yoongi felt himself shrinking smaller than Jimin, and Jimin was already quite tiny for his age.

Jimin’s face was too blank for a child. He peered at Yoongi as if he knew every secret thought Yoongi contained. With words and tone a little too old for someone his age, Jimin asked, “What business do you have with my dad?”

“ Woof? ” Tae also asked.

The same business I’ve been having , Yoongi thought, trying to hide his grimace. He liked Jimin, and Tae, he really did. He liked---loved at this point---Namjoon, too, and he wanted to show everyone he had nothing but good intentions. While it was amusing, something to chuckle about with Namjoon later, it still felt a bit overwhelming to sometimes be interrogated by a kindergarten.

At that point, Yoongi had to remind himself he couldn’t blame Jimin for being overprotective about his father.

Yoongi bent down to Jimin’s level, sincerity planted on his face. “As always, romantic.”

It couldn’t have been easy for Jimin to watch his parents separate, his mom move to another country, and every person after her only wanted to be with Namjoon for selfish reasons. Yoongi got that. He and his mother went through the same thing when he was a kid, too.

Jimin crossed his arms and Yoongi had to resist the urge to coddle him. Turning to Tae, Jimin asked, “Do we believe him?”

Tae’s ears perked up and he gave a little hop as he barked happily. Jimin glanced back at Yoongi, this time more shyly, a rosy tint forming on his cheeks.

“My daddy has stuff to do tomorrow so he can’t be out super later,” Jimin explained. Yoongi nodded, reaching over to pet Tae and his chest warming up when Tae nuzzled into his palm.

“Okay.”

“And, um, he has to call me! So I know he’s okay. That’s what he told Jennie.” Most likely Namjoon told the babysitter to call him so he knew Jimin was okay, but Yoongi hummed regardless, and promised to make sure Namjoon called.

“All right, he will. Don’t worry, Minnie.” At that, Yoongi cupped his cheek, squeezing slightly, and it must have been too much, because Jimin’s face burn hotter and he scurried back into the apartment. Tae licked Yoongi’s knee, huffed, and trotted back inside.

Jimin ran into Namjoon’s legs and pouted until he was picked up. “Dad! Daddy, be careful, okay?”

“I know, I will. Don’t worry.” Namjoon left multiple kisses on Jimin’s face until the boy was red-faced and a giggling mess. “Be good, ‘kay? Listen to Jennie and make sure Tae behaves, too. I love you.”

Jimin squeezed his arms around Namjoon’s neck and something weird lodged itself in Yoongi’s throat, maybe his heart. How Namjoon interacted with his family was one of the things Yoongi adored about him. Hopefully, he could continue to witness it for days to come. Hopefully, he could become more integrated into Namjoon’s family.

“I love you, too,” Jimin said as Namjoon placed him back down. Jimin then gave a short wave to Yoongi and ran off to find Jennie and Tae.

Yoongi’s smile felt like a bright, embarrassing mess on his face, but Namjoon didn’t tease him for it, only kissed him as he closed the door behind him.

“Ready?” Namjoon asked against his mouth, kissing him twice more before grasping his hand.

“Always.”

11962824,2017,1048,135.0,6.0,"Letters to Jungkook

Author's Note:

I don't like Justin Bieber but bless his existence because Jungkook smashes his covers and brings me to tears. Jungkook's voice in his 2U cover was probably the sweetest, buttery honey silk I've ever heard. Baby boy is now an adult. Happy Birthday, love. <3

Letters to Jungkook~

Jungkook, I still remember the day we met four years ago. You were so small back then, our scrawny baby maknae who looked like a gust of wind could topple him over. You were also very shy and soft spoken, but polite. You listened well and followed what you were told to do without complaint. I remember when you joined and what Bang PD-Nim said when he introduced us. He said that out of all the companies who wanted you, you chose his because you saw me rap and felt inspired. Since that day I'm still grateful for you, and not just for that. I've had the utmost privilege of having you by my side and watching you grow and build. As an artist, you inspire me. As your leader, you make me proud. As your hyung, I hold you very dear to me. Just because you're 21 now and a wall of muscles doesn't change the fact that you will always be our baby maknae. Happy Birthday, Jungkook-ah, love Namjoon

Yahh. Go back to your timid twig days, brat. You respected your elders so well back then, and you were quiet. My peace has been shattered. I'm only half kidding. Ah, my little Jungkookie-ah, what to say, what to say... well, Happy Birthday for one. It's hard to believe you're 21 already, where has the time gone? You were just a baby like, yesterday. Anyway, we may bicker a lot and find many things to argue about, but knowing you has been one of my greatest gifts. Watching you grow out of your shell was a treat and it helped me become comfortable enough to leave my own. You always seemed so young but you constantly worked hard, harder than anyone I know, and you never complained. It took time but there's so much you've opened up to me, to us, which has made us close. I never thought I would find family in you, but I'm glad I did. Never change, brat. Love, Jin

Happy Birthday, kid. Time has changed but you haven't, and I respect you for that. In the beginning you were quiet and hid in yourself but gradually you opened up and grew comfortable with us. It was nice to be able to witness your growth both as our maknae and a spectacular artist. You're young but already accomplished many things some people could only dream of. I find that inspiring and I hope you never dwindle on your dreams or stop thriving. Seeing how you are now from the way before, I still find that you're the same. Cute and shy, hard working... but you're not afraid of being yourself around us and it shows. You've matured well, kid, you've made hyung very proud. Love, Yoongi

There were faded tear stains on the next letter.

KOOKIE-AH. >:c 21 backwards is 12 just so you know. Ahhh, I will never forget when we all met and you were the tiniest cutest thing I'd ever seen. You could've fit in my pocket if I tried but you always avoided contact with others. Now you're big and strong and won't stop throwing your hyungs around as if we're dolls. Mean. On a serious note, Jungkook, I'm really happy you decided on Big Hit because for the past four years I've got to call one of the most talented, important person I know my sweet dongsaeng. You make every day an adventure and never fail to make me laugh and smile. I love you so much and am so lucky I've gotten to grow with you. Sharing the stage with you is one of the many things I cherish the most because watching you do what you love most makes me most happy. Plus, I can see how much you've grown since we started this amazing journey. Love you always, Hobi

Growing up is both frightening and beautiful. Many changes get made in the process but for us it's different, something more special. I have always looked at you as my baby brother, someone I hold close and precious to me. I want to protect you always and look after you, but you're an adult now, Kookie. Yet, looking at you I can still see the soft, shy boy I met years ago who still makes me happy and warm. You've grown up so well and have matured a lot since we've debuted. The changes you've made to yourself shines bright and I'm grateful for your glow. I think we're all lucky to have each other but you, our maknae, complete us especially. I can't imagine living without you, without singing and dancing with you. Without laughing with you, it's something unthinkable. Please keep smiling for hyung (and learn to call me that, too ;c) and for yourself, and continue on doing what you love. Love you always Jungkookie, Jimin~

p.s 2U is my new favorite cover of yours. Once again you went above and beyond <3

p.p.s Happy Birthday, bunny. <33

Wow. How does it feel to be old? I can't believe our baby is now 21. Don't be fooled Jungkookie-ah, just because you're an adult now doesn't mean you're still not our baby. MY baby, at least. Don't tell them, but I read everyone else's letters and they all summed up how I feel right now. When we first met, you seemed shy and awkward. When we started out in this group I didn't want anyone to feel left out or think they didn't belong, so I did my best to get you out of your cute shell. I regret that. You were obedient and adorable and now you've got a smart mouth and throw me around when you don't get your way. You keep working out and I've told you on many accounts to stop, but you don't listen! The least you can do is keep your sleeves rolled down, I don't want to see your bulging biceps. They torment me enough in my nightmares. But sweet little Jungkookie-ah, regardless of that, you are my best friend, my little brother , my sweet maknae who I will always be there for and will never stop loving or caring for. Please quit throwing me around, much love, Tae

...

end.

Author's Note:

This was something different for me but I hope it wasn't too trashy. What really matters is that it's Jungkook's day and I hope he's enjoyed so far to his fullest. <3"

ocd yoongi is just so good to write honestly

maybe this is a little echausting to read, i dont know.

in depth talk of bones and everything they do

YOUR BONES ARE BREAKING AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

yoongi smooths the front of his shirt with flat hands, terrified to press too hard.

YOUR BONES ARE DETERIORATING AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

he pulls at the fabric, wanting it off, wanting to see, wanting to see what's happening to his ribcage.

YOUR BONES ARE FALLING APART. NOTHING HOLDS THEM TOGETHER.

he thinks about the plastic skeleton in his high school biology classroom. thinks about the strings tied around the joints. thinks about the strings fraying.

YOUR BONES ARE BRITTLE. WHAT DID YOU DO TO MAKE THEM SO BRITTLE.

he hums loud and shakes his head, locks his fingers together. it’s a little better but not enough.

DON’T THEY HURT? CAN’T YOU FEEL YOUR BONES BREAKING?

yoongi makes a strangled sound in the back of his throat and jimin looks over, eyes tired and colors waning.

yoongi coughs, keeps coughing and pretends that’s what he meant to do with his throat all along. this is so much worse, he can feel his ribs hitting his lungs and they’re coming apart, and what can he do?

jimin smooths a hand down his back and yoongi wonders if he can feel vertebrae separating under his fingertips.

he ends up standing and getting water from the kitchen, acting out the whole scene.

./

the studio is much cooler, nicer, and neater.

he sheds his clothes and checks, checks, checks. presses on his pelvic bones and touch his elbows to his knees, and very very very carefully feels his ribs, feels where they’re connected to his sternum, and it’s ok, they’re not coming loose, it’s ok, they’re not brittle, it’s ok for now.

BUT YOU CAN’T REALLY BE SURE, CAN YOU?

yoongi pulls his clothes on again, not thinking about how his knees ache a little when he stands up. patellas are meant to feel like that.

exhausted, he stares at his screensaver, a picture that jungkook took in sweden. ducks in a pond. birds have hollow bones.

./

it’s not so bad, a lot of the time.

some of the time it’s all he can think about.

find the percentage of yoongi’s time that he spends thinking about bones.

./

jungkook cracks his knuckles.

it’s not that yoongi minds -- it’s more of just, a vague horror that revs quietly in his head.

the leather upholstery rubs the backs of his knees.

HOW DO TENDONS HOLD BONES TOGETHER. THEY COULD BREAK AT ANY TIME.

he blinks and jungkook cracks his knuckles, pressing each one into his palm until it gives and the joint is pushed outward and then snaps back, the sound dulled by the traffic outside the car.

HE’S PULLING HIS BONES APART ON PURPOSE.

yoongi sighs and dips his head between his knees, feels eyes on his and sits up again.

“everything ok?” namjoon’s voice from the front seat, somehow sensing everything.

yoongi gives a plain rasp, summoned from uneven air passing his vocal chords.

no one says anything else, and then they’re home and he does not want to think about bones anymore. he wants to peel his flesh apart and take out his skeleton.

they’re ordering chicken for dinner. birds have hollow bones.

./

yoongi cannot sleep.

he thinks he’s maybe seventy percent for today. fourteen or so hours spent thinking about bones.

yoongi opens naver on his phone and positions his thumbs over the shift and ㅂ keys.

something has to help. even if it’s worse maybe his head will explode and he’ll never think again, which at this point sounds rather peaceful.

without hesitating any longer he types bones into the search bar and is met with images of skeletons and articles about arthritis.

EARLY ONSET ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.

he taps on an image and studies the labeled pieces, as he has too many times before.

somehow, somehow he ends up on a page about keeping bones healthy, and it recommends calcium pills.

he grinds his teeth. calcium…. calcium for bones.

CALCIUM DEPOSITS SIT RIGHT BENEATH THE SKIN.

calcium.

he gets out of bed in darkness and heads right for the kitchen, opening cabinets and drawers until he finds the vitamins. almost frantically, he scans the labels: vitamin A, vitamin C, fiber, iron, B12.

sleeping pills, cough syrup, and a single pack of instant oatmeal sit at the very back of the cupboard. yoongi grinds his teeth and almost laughs.

not just oatmeal, oatmeal buried behind things that jungkook would never look for. he says vitamins smell really bad and taste even worse.

yoongi sighs and runs a hand through his hair, unsure and shaky. snatching a napkin from the counter, he tears off all the corners deliberately. it puts him in neutral for a moment, and the relief is welcome.

./

yoongi feels almost-crazy.

like if he had one more thing wrong with him namjoon might have him committed.

./

hoseok is insistent about stretching. yoongi usually avoids it, trying to touch his toes and pulling at his elbows before giving up and going right into practice.

hoseok catches him up today, insisting insisting.
yoongi ends up on the rug in the living room, watching hoseok roll his ankles.

HOSEOK BROKE HIS ANKLE WHEN HE WAS TWELVE.

“stretching is important, because it’s the same as applying heat when you’re injured. it relaxes the muscles, moves the blood around, doesn’t let the joints stay stiff.”

yoongi listens and watches, and somehow this isn’t bothering him as much.

“you know, tendons are like elastic! they’re pulled pretty tight around bones and muscle, but they’re meant to stretch. you wouldn’t be able to move at all if they were all pulled taught, you know?”

yoongi hums and frowns a little, thinking about this.

“the point is, stretching’s good for you.”

hoseok reaches for his toes, fingers straining. yoongi tentatively begins following hoseok, putting his legs in front of him and leaning down, arms out.

his ribs feel fine against his thighs.

it’s a bit like a routine, hoseok’s stretches. pretzel legs and then arm pulling, neck rolling.

yoongi does it twice. it makes him feel looser in a good way -- airy. breathable.

if hoseok’s bones don’t break, maybe yoongi’s won’t either.
